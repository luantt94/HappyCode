Traveling in Their Footsteps
World
Many people know about Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus. They were explorers who traveled around the world. But Elise Wortley wants people to know about female explorers too.
Wortley reads books about the journeys of great female explorers. She learns what they wore on their journeys. She learns what equipment they took with them. She learns what they ate. Then, Wortley "follows in their footsteps." She travels to the same places. She wears the same kind of clothes. She carries the same kind of equipment. She eats the same foods.
Alexandra David-Neel was a French-Belgian explorer. She traveled through Asia at the beginning of the 1900s. One place Neel visited was India. So, Wortley visited India too. She wore a wool coat like David-Neel's. At night, she slept in a canvas tent, like David-Neel.
Nan Shepherd explored Scotland in the 1940's. She walked through the Cairngorm Mountains. So, Wortley walked through the Cairngorm Mountains too. Wortley wore leather boots. The boots look like Shepherd's boots.
Wortley hopes her trips will inspire new female explorers.

Elise Wortley loves traveling. She is also very interested in female explorers of the past - women who took journeys all over the world. Female explorers had many achievements. But most aren't well-known, because they were women. Wortley wants people to learn about female explorers. So, she "follows in their footsteps," by recreating their journeys.
On her journeys, Wortley travels the same routes the female explorers took. She wears the same kind of clothes they wore. She eats the same kinds of foods they ate, and uses the same kind of equipment they used. On one trek, she made a wooden backpack from an old chair. To plan her trips, Wortley learns all she can about the women's journeys. Then, travel experts help her plan the best routes.
One of Wortley's treks was in India, where she recreated the journey of Alexandra David-Neel. David-Neel was a French-Belgian explorer. She traveled in the early 1900's. David-Neel traveled through China, India, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. When recreating David-Neel's India journey, Wortley slept under an old canvas tent and wore a heavy wool coat. It was actually David-Neel's book about her travels, called My Journey to Lhasa, that got Wortley interested in travel. She first read the book when she was 16 years old.
Another explorer who inspired Wortley was Nan Shepherd. Shepherd walked all over Scotland's Cairngorm Mountains. On her trip, Wortley dressed like Shepherd did in the 1940's. Under her coat she wore a cotton blouse, wool tights, socks, and a sweater. She also had leather boots. For light, Wortley used candles, just like Shepherd.
Wortley hopes her travels into the past will inspire the female adventurers of the future!

Traveling in Their Footsteps
World
Have you heard of the explorers Alexandra David-Neel, Nan Shepherd, or Freya Stark? Probably not. And Elise Wortley thinks that's a shame. Wortley wants people to learn about explorers who have been overlooked by history, because they were women.
To raise awareness of their achievements, Wortley has been recreating the journeys of some great female explorers from the past. She travels the same routes, wears clothes they would have worn, eats the same foods, and uses the same kind of equipment. This means no modern technology!
Wortley plans her trips carefully. She consults travel experts and local guides. Researching explorers' clothing and equipment is one of her favorite parts of the planning. In India, she wore a heavy wool coat, and carried a basket that she tied together with rope. She also had a wooden backpack she made from an old chair.
One female explorer was Alexandra David-Neel. She was a French-Belgian explorer who traveled through China, India, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia, and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When following her route, Wortley slept under an old canvas tent. She also relied on two hot water bottles to stay warm in the freezing Himalayas!
Back when Wortley was 16, she read David-Neel's book My Journey to Lhasa. "The book opened my teenage eyes to the incredible story of a woman traveling," she says. After college, Wortley worked for a travel company, where her love for travel blossomed. Then, in her late 20's, she decided to go to India to retrace David-Neel's route.
Another explorer Wortley followed was Nan Shepherd, an early 20th century Scottish writer who explored Scotland's Cairngorm Mountains. Wortley walked through the mountains and climbed Ben Nevis, the tallest peak in the United Kingdom. She wore clothes from the 1940's - a cotton blouse, wool tights, socks, and a sweater, plus a tweed coat, and leather boots. Wortley brought candles for light, and a gas cooker for cooking food.
Wortley has followed in the footsteps of other female explorers too, including British-Italian explorer and travel writer Freya Stark. Stark visited Iran's Alamut Valley in the 1930's. And Wortley's list keeps growing. By bringing more female explorers of the past to people's attention, Wortley hopes to inspire the next generation of female adventurers.

Iceland. Bangladesh. Portugal. Ecuador. Japan. These are just a few of the many countries Trevor Rainbolt has traveled to - without ever leaving his computer chair! The 23-year-old from Los Angeles, California, USA, is a professional GeoGuessr player. GeoGuessr is an online geography game where players have to guess a mystery location as quickly as possible. The more exact a player's guess is, the more points they earn.
In GeoGuessr, players are shown one 360-degree panoramic picture from Google Maps Street View, which shows users images taken from different spots across the globe. Then, players zoom in, looking for clues. Details such as trees and plants, street signs, and even shadows, all help pinpoint a location. For example, France is the only country that has blue stickers on their utility poles. So, if you see the blue stickers you'll know you're in France. In GeoGuessr, players are also exposed to the cultural aspects of each area, such as its language and architecture.
After years of exploring the world through GeoGuessr, Rainbolt can name the country in any picture in under a second. In 2021, Rainbolt started posting videos of himself playing GeoGuessr on social media. Today, he has more than 600,000 followers. Rainbolt also posts videos giving tips to help other GeoGuessr players. "I would recommend learning what side of the road most countries drive on," he says. Then, when you see how people are driving their cars, you'll be able to narrow down the country.
If you figured out that your image was taken in the USA, Rainbolt has facts to help you identify which of the 50 states it was taken in. For example, Oregon is the only state that doesn't have the word "limit" on their speed limit signs.
Rainbolt has been enjoying his GeoGuessr journey. He says he learned so much about the world that he never would have known without the game. "If anyone out there is trying to see the world and experience different cultures," he says, "GeoGuessr is such a good way to do it." Playing GeoGuessr has even inspired Rainbolt to get up from his chair, and travel to see the places on his computer screen, in person!

Trevor Rainbolt has an interesting job. This 23-year-old from Los Angeles, California, USA, is a professional GeoGuessr player. GeoGuessr is an online geography game. Players are shown a picture from a random location on Earth. Then, they have to guess the location as quickly and as accurately as possible. The more exact a player's guess is, the more points they get.
In GeoGuessr, players are shown one 360-degree photo from Google Maps Street View. (Street View shows users images taken from different locations across the globe.) Players can make the image larger to look for clues, such as special trees, or certain shadows. Players can look for cultural differences, such as signs in a certain language, or a special type of building. It's also helpful to notice the side of the street cars are driving on.
In 2021, Rainbolt started posting videos about GeoGuessr on social media. On some videos he's playing the game. On others, he's giving tips and clues to players. One clue, for example, is that France is the only country with blue stickers on its utility poles. For pictures from the USA, Rainbolt helps players identify the state. Oregon, for example, has speed limit signs that are different from those of all other US states. 
Rainbolt has been playing GeoGuessr since 2016. Today, he can correctly guess the country in the picture in under a second. Rainbolt says he has learned a lot about the world playing GeoGuessr, without ever leaving his computer chair. "If anyone out there is trying to see the world and experience different cultures," he says, "GeoGuessr is such a good way to do it."

Do you like to travel? Play GeoGuessr! GeoGuessr is an online game. You look at a 360-degree photo of someplace in the world. What place is it? You have to guess!
Trevor Rainbolt is a professional GeoGuessr player. You can see his videos online. Rainbolt helps players play GeoGuessr. Rainbolt teaches people to look for clues. To look for clues, Rainbolt makes the photo larger. Does he see plants or trees? Plants or trees can be clues. Some countries have special trees. Rainbolt also looks at the styles of buildings. What country has that style of building?
Many GeoGuessr photos show cars and roads. Look at the cars and roads to get information. Do cars drive on the right or left side of the road? This is another clue. Street signs help too. Players look at letters or numbers on the signs.
Rainbolt and other GeoGuessr players learn geography when they play. They "travel" around the world in their chairs!

Dream Home - Dream Price?

Italy is famous for art, history, and culture - not to mention incredible food. Visitors come to enjoy its beautiful Mediterranean beaches, majestic mountains, and breathtaking natural sites. While tourism is on the rise, however, the population of Italy has been declining recently. Small towns have been affected the most, as many young people leave rural areas to settle in cities or go abroad, where job prospects are better. Worried about their future, some of these towns are using a creative approach to revitalize the local population numbers - by offering houses that cost just one euro!
Many people who saw advertisements for one-euro homes were sure it was a joke. But not everyone. Australian Mark Kopun was traveling in Europe when he heard about the homes. Excited and intrigued, he set off for the sunny town of Mussomeli in Sicily to check it out. "When I got there, I fell in love with the place and the people," says Kopun. As to the one-euro homes, it was much more expensive than that! All of the homes in Mussomeli are run-down and need extensive renovations, including Kopun's. Kopun believes he'll probably spend around �20,000 to fix up his "one-euro house" - but that's still a great deal! And for people who prefer moving right in, there are towns such as Biccari in southeast Italy offering inexpensive houses that don't need any work at all.
Many of the homebuyers snapping up these bargains are from the USA, China, Argentina, and different parts of Europe, in addition to Australia. Even before the COVID-19 crisis complicated international travel, many foreign buyers only saw the houses over the Internet before buying. Meredith Tabbone from Illinois, USA, bid �5,555 at an auction for a three-bedroom house in Sambuca, Sicily - and won! Although Tabbone had never been to Sambuca before, she was pleasantly surprised when she arrived. "At the end, it turned out to be much better than I thought," says Tabbonne. And how do her new neighbors feel? "The locals are very excited to have people coming back to move to their town. They're very warm, friendly, sweet, and curious," says Tabbonne.
For these new homeowners, their dream house keys unlock an Italian adventure!

Tourists love sunny Italy for its culture, beautiful nature, and delicious food. Many people visit, but the number of residents has been going down recently. Young people - especially from small towns - leave home to find jobs in the big cities or abroad. In small towns all over Italy, people are worried that their population numbers are shrinking. The solution? Some towns are hoping to attract new residents with houses that cost just one euro!
Many people who saw advertisements for "one-euro homes" thought it was a joke. Mark Kopun from Australia wanted to see for himself, so he went to the town of Mussomeli in Sicily. "When I got there, I fell in love with the place and the people," he says. He bought a one-euro home, but it needed renovations. Kopun believes he'll probably spend around �20,000 to fix up his "one-euro home," but that's still a bargain!
Buyers for one-euro homes come from all over Europe, USA, China, Argentina, and other places. Some only see pictures on the Internet before buying. Meredith Tabbone, from Illinois, USA, bought a house in Sambuca, Sicily, without visiting first. The town held an auction with prices starting at one euro. Tabbone bid �5,555 for a three-bedroom house - and she won! When she finally went to Sambuca, Tabbone was pleasantly surprised by her new home. "It turned out to be much better than I thought," she says, although it cost more than one euro. Tabbone also likes her Italian neighbors who are excited to have new people move into town.
For bargain hunters like Kopun and Tabbone, their dream homes are the beginning of an Italian adventure!

Italy is a beautiful country. Tourists love to visit! But Italy has a problem. There aren't a lot of jobs in Italy's small towns. Young people from small towns go to big cities to find work. This is bad for the small towns. They need more people.
One town had an idea. Cheap homes will bring new people. Now, they sell homes for one euro!
Mark Kopun is from Australia. He bought a one-euro home in a small town called Mussomeli. First, Kobun must fix his new home. Then, he can live there. Kobun will pay around �20,000 to fix the house. But Kobun is happy. He thinks �20,000 for a house is a bargain!
Meredith Tabbone from the USA saw a picture of a house on the Internet. It was in a small Italian town called Sambuca. There was an auction for the house. Tabbone bid �5,555 - and she got the house! Then, she went to Italy to see her house. According to Tabbone, �5,555 for a house with three bedrooms is a bargain!




The Art Trail of Happiness
World
There is a park called Parr Park in Texas, USA. The park has beautiful tall trees and low hills. It has a trail to walk on with something very special. There are more than 4,000 rocks next to the trail. Why are the rocks special? There is a painting on every rock!
Some of the rocks next to the trail have colorful pictures. Some have just one word, such as "love." There are rocks with paintings of music, sports, movies, and famous people. One rock has a picture of a nurse with the word "Hero." There are animal rocks too. There are happy yellow bees and a cat eating pizza. You can see many different dogs in the "dog park."
People from all over the world paint and send rocks to Parr Park. Some of the people are professional artists. But young children also paint and send rocks to Parr Park. Anyone can do it!  You can paint a rock for the "trail of happiness" too!

The Art Trail of Happiness
World
Parr Park, with its beautiful tall trees and low hills, is a lovely place to hike. Located in Grapevine, Texas, USA, it had very few visitors after the city shut down because of the pandemic. Then, something magical happened. Beautiful hand-painted rocks began to appear along the hiking trail. Suddenly, a walk in the park became an exciting adventure.
There are more than 4,000 rocks by the trail - each a small work of art. Some are very colorful. Some have a one-word message, such as "love" or "faith." There are areas with rocks that share a theme, like music, nature, movie stars, and sports. In the teacher-themed area, a rock with a yellow ruler says "Teachers Rule." Another reads "Best Teacher Ever." In honor of medical workers, there's a nurse wearing a name tag that says "Hero." There's also an animal area with happy yellow bees and a cartoon cat eating pizza. You can find your favorite pet painted on a rock in the "dog park" too.
Where did all these amazing rocks come from? Photographer Ron Olsen put the first rocks by the trail. Then a businessman named Chris Penny added more. The two men began working together to make a special place for the community. "We wanted to make it a getaway for people, and give parents something safe to do outdoors with their children," says Olsen.
Today, hundreds of people visit Parr Park every week. And anyone - from two-year-olds to professional artists - can paint a rock for the trail. Rocks have been sent from all over the USA and abroad. Chris Penny calls the kilometer-long trail "a trail of happiness."

The Art Trail of Happiness
World
Parr Park is a lovely place with a kilometer-long nature trail that passes through tall trees and over gentle hills. The park is located in the city of Grapevine, not far from Dallas, Texas, USA. Although Grapevine is filled with historic buildings, miles of hiking trails, restaurants, and galleries, it almost completely shut down during the pandemic. That is, until Parr Park was turned into a magical wonderland. Today, the nature trail is lined with more than 4,000 hand-painted rocks, and walking the trail is an unforgettable adventure.
Hiking along the trail, visitors encounter rocks and stones - each a work of art. Some blaze with bright colors, while others show a single word, such as "love" or "faith." The many rocks are organized by themes, including music, nature, movie stars, and sports teams, to name a few. There's an image of a nurse wearing a name tag that reads "Hero" in the section honoring health-care workers. There are rocks devoted to teachers with messages such as "Teachers Rule," showing a picture of a yellow ruler, or "Best Teacher Ever," surrounded by delicate flowers. One area is filled with all types of animals - everything from a cartoon cat eating pizza to a family of smiling yellow bees painted on three separate stones. There's even a special "dog park" with pictures of various breeds.
Where did these one-of-a-kind rocks come from? Local photographer Ron Olsen put the original stones along Parr Park's walking trail. When businessman Chris Penny saw them, he added some of his own. Olsen and Penny met, and decided to work together to transform the trail for the community. "We wanted to make it a getaway for people, and give parents something safe to do outdoors with their children," says Olsen. They also hoped it would give people a way to deal with the stress of the pandemic.
Hundreds of people visit the trail every week, and rocks created by anyone who wants to participate - from two-year-olds to professional artists - continue to arrive in Grapevine by mail from the USA and abroad. "It's incredible to see that people from all over are now painting rocks to turn my community into a trail of happiness," says Penny.





Ghana is known for its colorful woven textiles with bold, geometric patterns. But these fabrics are more than just a fashion statement. Each one has a meaning, which is expressed through its colors and designs. The color blue, for example, symbolizes peace, while a zigzag pattern means that life is full of twists and turns. Some textiles represent aspects of Ghanaian history or culture; others tell stories.
Despite the beauty of these fabrics, the country's textile industry has been struggling. In 2004, the government even started a national campaign to encourage people to wear Ghanaian fabrics to support the industry. Then, in 2020, COVID-19 broke out, and the Ghanaian textile industry took another hit.
But a local textile company had an idea. They decided to adapt their designs to the current reality. Only a few months into the COVID crisis, Ghana Textiles Printing (GTP) released a new line of corona-themed fabrics. "We set out to look for ways of telling the story of COVID-19 for generations to come in a positive light," says Stephen Kofi Badu, GTP's marketing director.
GTP's new designs reflect how Ghana's government has been handling the pandemic. For example, one fabric features round eyeglasses floating against a swirling red, white and green background. This is because Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, who has been giving weekly television updates about the coronavirus, wears round eyeglasses. GTP named the fabric Fellow Ghanaians, as Akufo-Addo always begins his updates with those words.
Another design represents the three-week lockdown Ghana endured at the start of the pandemic. It has a repeating pattern of orange padlocks against a background of stripes and circles. It reminds people of when they had to stay home. Another commemorates when borders were closed and no air travel was allowed. This design shows blue airplane propellers arranged around padlocks, surrounded by tiny keys.
 
Recently GTP released a fabric collection called This Too Shall Pass. One of the fabrics in the collection shows eggs in a nest, symbolizing new life. In another design, trees repeat against stripes in shades of brown. One half of the tree has dried, dying branches; the other side has red branches, alive and growing. These natural images represent a hopeful future, after the crisis.

Fabrics That Tell Stories
World
Traditional clothing in Ghana is made of woven cloth with colorful patterns and designs. These designs have deep meanings. Some represent Ghanaian history or culture. Others teach about important qualities, or life lessons. And others tell stories.
Despite the beautiful fabrics, however, business has been bad for Ghana's textile companies for years. Then, when the COVID-19 crisis began, the situation got even worse. But a local textile company, Ghana Textiles Printing (GTP), thought of an idea. They would help business by making new designs inspired by the COVID crisis.
Some of GTP's new designs show what Ghana's government has done during the pandemic. For example, Akufo-Addo, Ghana's president, gave weekly updates on TV at the start of the crisis. Since the president wears round eyeglasses, one of the new fabrics has a pattern with eyeglasses against a red, white and green background. GTP named the fabric Fellow Ghanaians, because Akufo-Addo started each television appearance with these words.
At the start of the pandemic, the government ordered citizens to stay at home for three weeks. So, another design shows a repeating pattern of orange padlocks with stripes and blue circles. During this time, the airports were also closed, so another design has blue airplane propellers around large padlocks and small keys.
 
GTP has also created designs that look toward the future. One new fabric shows eggs in a nest, symbolizing new life. Another design has trees against brown stripes. One side of the tree has unhealthy branches; the other side has red branches, which are alive and growing. These natural images represent the hope of life continuing after the crisis.

Fabrics That Tell Stories
World
Fabric from Ghana has lots of colors and patterns. People make clothing from the fabric. They wear it at special events - like weddings. But special events stopped during COVID-19. And fabric companies needed to get more customers.
The company Ghana Textiles Printing (GTP) had an idea. They made new fabrics. The patterns remind people of the COVID-19 crisis.
Ghana's president is Nana Akufo-Addo. At the start of the crisis, Akufo-Addo spoke on television to the Ghanaian people. So, GTP made a new fabric. The fabric has a pattern with small, round eyeglasses. These are the kind of eyeglasses the president wears. Another fabric has stripes, blue circles and padlocks. This reminds people that they stayed home during the crisis. The government also closed the airports. So GTP made fabric with blue airplane propellers, orange padlocks and small keys.
Now, GTP wants customers to feel hopeful. One new fabric shows eggs in a nest. Another has trees with red branches. What do you think they mean? GTP is looking toward the future, after the crisis.




Happy Happiness Day!
World
Do you live in a "happy country"? The United Nations (UN) can tell you. Every year, the UN makes a list of countries in the world. The first country on the list is the happiest country in the world. The last country on the list isn't a very happy place. The UN thinks happiness is important. That's why they make the list. It's called the World Happiness Report. People in 156 different countries answer questions for the report.
The report shows many things. Rich countries are happier than poor countries. Freedom to make choices is important for happiness. Do you volunteer? According to the report, helping others makes people feel happy.
Finland was the happiest country on the list for three years. Most Finns feel satisfied with their lives. They can depend on their friends and neighbors.
You can read a new World Happiness Report on March 20 every year. Why March 20? That's the UN's "International Day of Happiness." Happy Happiness Day!

Happy Happiness Day!
World
How important is happiness to you? The United Nations (UN) thinks happiness is very important. That's why they made March 20 the UN's International Day of Happiness. Every year, they also publish their World Happiness Report on that day. The report compares how happy people are in 156 different countries around the world.
How does the World Happiness Report get its information? It uses surveys that ask people about how happy they feel. People answer questions about what makes them happy - friends, family, money, the environment, and so on. Included in the report is a list of countries from the happiest to the least happy.
Generally, the report shows that rich countries are happier than poor countries. It also shows that the more control you have over your life, the happier you are. One interesting item from the report shows the importance of helping others. For example, doing volunteer work makes people feel happy. And each report has a theme. In 2018, the theme was how moving to a new country affected happiness. More recently, the theme was where people are happier - in cities or rural areas.
Finland was the happiest country on the UN's list for three years in a row. One reason is that people there feel satisfied with their lives. Another is that they believe that their friends and neighbors will help out when things get difficult. John F. Helliwell is an editor of the World Happiness Report. Helliwell believes happy people "trust each other and care about each other, and that's what fundamentally makes for a better life."

Happy Happiness Day!
World
How important is happiness to you? Many countries believe that their citizens have a right to happiness, and some countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and France, even include the word "happiness" in their constitutions. In 2012, the United Nations (UN) gave happiness its own holiday. Every year, on March 20, the International Day of Happiness celebrates the importance of happiness in the lives of people around the world. And on that same day, the UN releases its World Happiness Report, which measures and compares the happiness of people in 156 different countries.
After surveying people around the world, the World Happiness Report produces a list of countries from most to least happy. According to Professor Jeffrey Sachs, director of the UN office that publishes the report, the survey's questions basically ask people to "imagine that life is a ladder, with the bottom rung being the worst life you can imagine and the top rung being the best life you can imagine." Then, people say where they think they are on the ladder. The report evaluates countries on social, economic and environmental factors that create feelings of happiness. Not surprising perhaps, the report shows that rich countries are happier than poor countries, and freedom to make life choices also increases happiness. Maybe less obvious is that generous people are happier than people who aren't. For example, people who donate to charity or do volunteer work were higher on the happiness scale.
Each yearly report also has a theme. In 2018, the theme was migration - how moving to a new country affected happiness. More recently, the report examined how levels of happiness are different for those living in either cities or rural areas.
Finland was number one on the list for three years in a row. That isn't because Finns smile all the time or express their emotions more. It's because they feel satisfaction with life, and know that they live in a country where they can depend on their fellow citizens during difficult times. As an editor of the World Happiness Report, John F. Helliwell says that happy people "trust each other and care about each other, and that's what fundamentally makes for a better life."





Can you imagine living without electricity? Without electricity, most routine tasks must be finished while there is daylight. However, electricity and other energy sources that provide light can be limited, expensive, and polluting. For almost one billion people in the world who don't have access to electric power, this is their daily reality. But for some people, there's hope. Barefoot College, an organization that is working to bring electricity to rural communities, is training women across the globe to be "Solar Mamas."
What do Solar Mamas do? They learn how to build, install, and maintain solar panels and batteries in order to provide their villages with electricity. The solar panels are used to turn the sun's energy into electricity, which is stored in the batteries. Barefoot College, located in Rajasthan, India, also has training centers in 96 other countries, including Zanzibar, Burkina Faso, and Madagascar. Solar Mamas, most of whom have never left home in their lives, travel as long as 19 hours to a Barefoot College training center, where they live and study for six months. "We actually create an environment where people can find something within themselves, which they never thought they had," says Sanjit "Bunker" Roy, the founder and director of Barefoot College. 
Instructors and students, who come from all over the world, often don't even speak the same language. In addition, many of the women who become Solar Mamas are illiterate. Instructors communicate with sign language and teach in a very creative way, which one instructor calls "learning by doing, doing by learning." They rely mostly on pictures, color-coded charts, and demonstrations. Students who can't read or write learn through listening and memorizing. When they finish studying, the Solar Mamas return to their villages to set up the solar power system, bringing a renewable energy source to their communities.
So far, more than 750 Solar Mamas serving 1,300 villages worldwide, have been trained by Barefoot College, and more training centers are being developed. Florentina Choc, a proud Solar Mama from Belize, says that after she returned home, "Something changed in the village, not like before when we stayed in the dark. Now, my village has light."

Solar Mamas
World
Almost one billion people in the world live without electricity. Most of them live in villages and small communities in developing countries. Because they don't have electricity to make light, these people work during the day. An organization called Barefoot College wants to help bring electricity to these communities. At Barefoot College, women learn how to build solar panels. With solar panels, they can collect energy from the sun and use it to make electricity for their communities. These women are called "Solar Mamas."
There are Barefoot College centers in more than 90 countries around the world. Solar Mamas travel to the nearest center to take a special six-month course in how to build solar panels. Most of these Solar Mamas have never left home before, but they travel long distances to go to Barefoot College. It can take them as long as 19 hours to get there!  
Teachers and students at Barefoot College come from many different countries. They often don't even speak the same language. Another problem is that many Solar Mamas don't know how to read or write. So, Solar Mamas must learn about solar energy in an unusual way. Teachers use sign language, charts, and a lot of pictures. They give demonstrations, too. Students learn by listening and memorizing. Then, the Solar Mamas return home to build solar panels in their communities.
So far, Barefoot College has trained more than 750 Solar Mamas. Florentina Choc is a proud Solar Mama from Belize. Choc says that after she returned home,"Something changed in the village, not like before when we stayed in the dark. Now, my village has light."

Solar Mamas
World
We use electricity every day. But about one billion people in the world don't have electricity. This makes their lives very hard. But they can get help at Barefoot College. It is a special school. Women learn how to build solar panels at Barefoot College. They learn how to get energy from the sun and make electricity. These women are called "Solar Mamas."
Solar Mamas are from villages all over the world. They come to Barefoot College centers. There are Barefoot College centers in more than 90 countries. Many Solar Mamas can't read or write. How do they learn to build solar panels? The teachers use a lot of pictures. They show the students what to do. Students must memorize a lot of information. Students study for six months. They go back to their villages. They build solar panels. Then, their villages have electricity!
Florentina Choc is a proud Solar Mama from Belize. Choc says, "Something changed in the village, not like before when we stayed in the dark. Now, my village has light."

A group of tourists walks down a dirt path through a forest in Tlaxcala, Mexico. As night falls, tiny dots of light appear. One by one, they flash among the trees until the forest comes alive with thousands of blinking lights. "It's almost like your eyes are playing tricks on you," one tourist says. He speaks quietly so he doesn't disturb the stars of the show - fireflies that live in this pine forest around 75 kilometers east of Mexico City.
The fireflies (actually beetles, not flies) live in this forest year round, and their mating season is from the end of June to the beginning of August. Female fireflies can't fly well, so they stay close to the ground. Each night from 8:30 to 9:30 during the mating season, the forest comes alive with light, as females flash their tails, attracting male fireflies - and plenty of tourists.
Tourists started coming to Nanacamilpa village in Tlaxcala in the 1990s. A rural cooperative called Piedra Canteada decided to supplement its logging business by opening up campsites for tourists. Then, in 2011, Piedra Canteada decided to capitalize on the magical fireflies. Suddenly, tourism was booming as thousands of eco-tourists flocked to the forest of more than six square kilometers. "One day we were a ghost town, and the next one, we were the most visited town in the state," says Nanacamilpa's mayor, V�ctor Hugo S�nchez Flores. New hotels and restaurants were built all over the village to accommodate more than 50,000 yearly visitors.
However, some people worry that the flood of tourists could hurt the insects. Because the females stay close to the ground, tourists might crush them with their feet. Tourists also bring artificial light (from cell phones, for example) which can interfere with the mating process. Prohibiting cell phones and flashlights, limiting the number of weekend visitors, and planting new trees are helping the fireflies survive. Additionally, researchers at the University of Chapingo are studying the fireflies to determine the best way to preserve the population.
"I couldn't believe the show we saw tonight," raved one visitor. Hopefully, the fireflies will continue to light up the forest far into the future.

Nature's Light Show
World
In Tlaxcala, Mexico, a group of tourists walks through a forest filled with thousands of tiny, blinking lights. "It's almost like your eyes are playing tricks on you," says one tourist. But it's no trick. The lights come from fireflies (which are actually beetles). Their mating season is from the end of June to the beginning of August. Each night of the mating season, from 8:30 to 9:30, the forest is filled with females lighting up to attract males.
Tourism in this area of Central Mexico started in the 1990s. A company called Piedra Canteada opened campsites for tourists near the Nanacamilpa village. Then, in 2011, Piedra Canteada started bringing tourists to watch the magical fireflies. Suddenly, tourism was booming. There are more than 50,000 visitors each year. "One day we were a ghost town, and the next one, we were the most visited town in the state," says V�ctor Hugo S�nchez Flores, Nanacamilpa's mayor.
However, some people worry that having too many tourists could harm the insects. Female fireflies can't fly well, so they stay close to the ground. This puts them in danger of being stepped on by tourists. Tourists also bring artificial light - from cell phones, for example - into the forests. This light can confuse the males during mating. Banning cell phones and flashlights, as well as limiting the number of weekend visitors, are helping to protect the fireflies. Additionally, researchers have been studying the fireflies to find the best way to preserve them. Hopefully, the fireflies will continue to light up the forest far into the future.

Nature's Light Show
World
There is a forest in Tlaxcala, Mexico. Thousands of fireflies live there. Fireflies are not actually flies. They're beetles.
Female fireflies shine a bright light from their tails. They shine the light to attract males for mating. So, the females only light up during mating season, in July. And they only light up for one hour each night. Visit the forest from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. any night in July. You'll see a forest full of blinking lights.
In 2011, tourists started coming to see the fireflies in Tlaxcala. Today, more than 50,000 visitors come each year to enjoy the light show. But some people worry about the tourists. Will they hurt the fireflies? Female fireflies can't fly well; they stay close to the ground. Tourists may step on them. Tourists also have cell phones and flashlights. These bring artificial light. The male fireflies think the artificial lights are females.
Scientists are trying to find ways to keep the fireflies safe. After all, the fireflies are the stars of the show!





Many cities in the world have winter festivals. In Oaxaca (wuh-HAH-kuh), Mexico, people celebrate Noche de R�banos. This means "Night of the Radishes". The festival is in December. The main event of the festival is a radish contest. People carve radishes to make sculptures!
Before the festival, the city plants radishes in special gardens. The radishes get very big. Some radishes weigh two kilograms. Some are 50 centimeters long.
Four days before the festival, contestants collect their radishes. They have three days to carve their radishes into different shapes, like people and animals. On December 23, contestants show their sculptures in Oaxaca's main square. Thousands of visitors walk around. They look at the amazing creations. Judges walk around, too. They choose the best sculpture. The winner gets 30,000 pesos (around $1,500 dollars).
Fernando Lopez was a contestant in Noche de R�banos. He said, "It feels great to see so many people come and see our artwork."

Night of the Radishes
World
It's a December evening, and thousands of people are standing in line in the central square of Oaxaca (wuh-HAH-kuh), Mexico. Everyone's here for a unique festival with sculptures made of giant radishes. It's time for Noche de R�banos, or Night of the Radishes.
Years ago, at Oaxaca's annual Christmas marketplace, farmers wanted to attract customers to their vegetable stalls. So, they would carve radish sculptures and display them at their stalls. Then, in 1897, Oaxaca's mayor, Francisco Vasconcelos, turned the radish-carving tradition into a yearly competition to be held each year on December 23.
Night of the Radishes has two categories for competitors. In the "free" category, they can carve anything they choose. In the "traditional" category, sculptures must relate to Oaxacan culture. The winning prize is 30,000 pesos, around $1,500 dollars. To hold their sculptures together, sculptors can only use wooden toothpicks and string.
Radishes are grown specifically for the competition. The radishes are planted in government-owned gardens. They are grown in a special way, so they have interesting shapes. The radishes are also very large. Some are as heavy as two kilograms, and longer than 50 centimeters! Four days before the festival, competitors pick their radishes. They then have three days to create their sculptures.
Finally, on December 23, stalls with incredible radish sculptures fill the square. Visitors and judges walk among the stalls looking over the creations. "It is something really beautiful," says competitor Fernando Lopez. "It feels great to see so many people come and see our artwork, that we create with so much care."

It's a December evening, and a long line of spectators winds around the central plaza in the city of Oaxaca (wuh-HAH-kuh), Mexico. Thousands of people are here for a unique celebration - a radish-carving festival, where competitors proudly display sculptures they carved out of giant radishes. It's time for Noche de R�banos, or Night of the Radishes.
Radishes were first brought to Mexico in the 16th century. Over the years, a local tradition developed at Oaxaca's annual Christmas marketplace. There, farmers would carve eye-catching displays of radishes to attract customers to their vegetable stalls. After the festival, the sculptures were used as centerpieces, decorating holiday tables. In 1897, Oaxaca's mayor, Francisco Vasconcelos, made the tradition official, and announced a radish-carving competition to be held each year on December 23.
Night of the Radishes has two categories for competitors. In the "free" category, they can carve anything they choose. In the more popular, "traditional" category, sculptures must relate to Oaxacan culture. The winning prize is 30,000 pesos, approximately $1,500 dollars. To build their radish masterpieces, competitors may only use organic materials - other vegetable material, wooden toothpicks, and string.
Competitors use radishes grown specifically for Noche de R�banos. They are planted in government-owned plots of land, and specially cultivated to be unusually-shaped and huge. Some are as heavy as two kilograms, and more than 50 centimeters long. Four days before the festival, participants harvest the radishes (approximately 10 tons of radishes are harvested each year!). Then, they have three days to prepare and carve their sculptures.
Finally, on December 23, the plaza is filled with stalls displaying the final works of art. Visitors and judges walk among the stalls observing the incredible creations. Competitors must keep their sculptures moist in the sun, constantly spraying them with water to keep them from wilting or turning brown.
Making the intricate sculptures takes patience, skill, and creativity. "We want people to see what we want to express through the radishes," says competitor Fernando Lopez. "It is something really beautiful. It feels great to see so many people come and see our artwork, that we create with so much care."




The Sweetest Art
World
A tourist in Japan holds up a wooden stick with a small, colorful sculpture on top. "Does this look like me?" he asks. The unique sculpture, which looks just like the tourist, is edible! It was created by Takahiro Yoshihara, an artist who practices amezaiku � traditional Japanese candy making.
Amezaiku, which means "candy craft", has been around for more than a thousand years. Brought to Japan from China in ancient times, the candy was originally used in religious ceremonies. Later, amezaiku evolved into a type of street performance with music and storytelling as part of the experience. In those days, amezaiku makers were peddlers traveling from town to town selling their treats. For hundreds of years, amezaiku artists performed at festivals, delighting both Japanese children and adults.
Today, amezaiku candy is made the same way as it was years ago with thick, hot, sugar syrup called mizuame. To begin, a ball of mizuame, which has been heated to 80 degrees Celsius, is put on the end of a wooden stick. "You do burn yourself when you first start making amezaiku," says Yoshihara, "but eventually, of course, your hands get used to it." Then, using his fingers and special candy scissors, the artist pulls and cuts the candy, transforming the ball into animals, flowers, and mythical creatures, such as dragons and winged horses. Artists have just five minutes to work, as the candy quickly starts to cool and harden. Finally, details like eyes, stripes, and shading are painted on with edible dyes. The completed lollipop is wrapped in plastic, and can stay fresh up to three weeks.  
Over the years, amezaiku has become less common in Japan. Today, only a handful of trained amezaiku artists remain. Like Yoshihara, Shinri Tezuka is keeping this ancient art alive in the 21st century. Tezuka runs amezaiku workshops out of his two stores in Tokyo, Japan. "I want to preserve this culture, so my shop and techniques will still be around in one thousand years," says Tezuka. And Yoshihara, who opened Japan's first amezaiku shop in 2008, wants customers to appreciate and have fun with his art. "But at the end of the day," he tells them, "I hope you find it delicious!"

"Does this look like me?" asks a tourist in Japan, holding a small, colorful lollipop next to his face. The lollipop looks just like the tourist! It was created by Takahiro Yoshihara, an artist who does amezaiku � traditional Japanese candy making.
Amezaiku has been around for more than one thousand years. It was first used in religious ceremonies. Later, candy makers added music and stories to entertain crowds while making the candy, and amezaiku became more like a performance. In those days, amezaiku artists didn't have their own shops. Instead, they traveled from town to town, selling their treats at festivals and other crowded places.
Today, amezaiku candy is made the same way as it was many years ago. Amezaiku starts as mizuame, a thick, hot, sugar syrup heated to 80 degrees Celsius. A ball of mizuame is put on the end of a wooden stick. Using only fingers and special candy scissors, the artist pulls and cuts the candy. Artists have to work very quickly because the candy starts to cool and harden within five minutes. The mizuame is shaped into flowers, animals, and other creatures, such as dragons and winged horses. Details are painted on with edible dye, and the artist wraps the lollipop in clear plastic.
Over the years, amezaiku has become less common in Japan. Yoshihara is one of only a handful of trained amezaiku artists working today. He opened Japan's first amezaiku shop in 2008, keeping this traditional art alive in the 21st century. Yoshihara wants customers to appreciate and have fun with his art. "But at the end of the day," he tells them, "I hope you find it delicious!"

Do you like candy? In Japan, people enjoy colorful lollipops called amezaiku. Special candy artists make them.
Amezaiku came to Japan from China hundreds of years ago. Amezaiku artists traveled from town to town in Japan to sell their candy. They went to festivals and other crowded places. Artists made the candy, and they also told stories and played music. People enjoyed the stories and songs. They loved eating the beautiful candy, too.  
 
Takahiro Yoshihara is a candy artist in Japan today. In 2008, he opened Japan's first amezaiku shop. You can buy many kinds of amezaiku animals, flowers, and other objects there. How does Yoshihara make amezaiku? First, he takes a ball of hot sugar syrup. Yoshihara puts the ball on a wooden stick. Then, he uses his fingers and scissors to make an animal or a flower. Yoshihara must work quickly � the syrup gets hard in five minutes! Finally, he paints the candy with a special dye. "I hope you find it delicious!" Yoshihara says.




Bosai Girls to the Rescue!
World
Japan has a lot of earthquakes and tsunamis. People must be ready for these natural disasters. But many young people in Japan don't prepare for these disasters. They think it's hard and not interesting. Misaki Tanaka has a solution. She started the organization Bosai Girls. The organization encourages young people to get ready for natural disasters. They do this by making preparing for a disaster more interesting.
For example, Bosai Girls makes boring evacuation drills "fun". How? People pretend there is an earthquake. Then, they compete to see who can get to safe places first. It's a game, and you use a smartphone app to play!
Bosai Girls also has special accessories, which help people during natural disasters. The accessories are fashionable. There are boots, and bags with maps. There are also special bracelets. People can use the bracelets ten different ways - even as a whistle or a tourniquet.
Many people come to Bosai Girls' activities. In the future Tanaka hopes to help people prepare for disasters all over the world.

Bosai Girls to the Rescue!
World
Japan is in an area where there are many earthquakes. The earthquake and following tsunami in 2011, was the worst in Japan's history. A young Japanese woman named Misaki Tanaka was deeply affected by this tragedy. In order to raise awareness about how to be prepared for natural disasters, she started an organization called Bosai Girls.
Bosai Girls means "girls take action to prevent disaster". Tanaka started the organization's website in 2013 to help Japan's citizens (especially millennials and women) to be better prepared for disasters. Bosai Girls holds events like "next-generation" evacuation drills. Using a special smartphone app, people compete to find the most evacuation centers in a particular area in a certain amount of time. Tanaka says making drills like games makes them more enjoyable.
Bosai Girls' tsunami awareness campaign is called #beORANGE. When people in coastal areas see bright orange flags, they know to immediately run to higher ground. So far, Bosai Girls has given around 400 orange flags to cities and towns all over Japan. Bosai Girls even use orange in their special rope bracelet which can be used in more than ten different ways during a crisis - including as a whistle or tourniquet. The bracelet is part of an accessories collection which has shoes that can be folded, bags covered with maps, and lightweight boots. Tanaka believes these fashionable accessories are more appealing to millennials than the usual disaster products.
Bosai Girls seems to be succeeding - more than 3,000 people come to their events, and some say Bosai Girls has "changed their lives". In the future, Tanaka wants to increase disaster preparedness around the world. Bosai Girls to the rescue!

Bosai Girls to the Rescue!
World
Japan is located in a region of the Pacific Ocean where a large number of the world's earthquakes occur. In 2011, the biggest earthquake in Japan's history, followed by a massive tsunami, caused major destruction. Out of the rubble of this natural disaster, Bosai Girls was born.
Bosai Girls founder, Misaki Tanaka, was deeply affected by the 2011 disaster. So, in August 2013, she started the Bosai Girls website to spread the word about disaster preparedness to Japan's citizens. Tanaka's creative approach especially targets millennials and women. "Bosai" means "disaster prevention" in Japanese, so Bosai Girls means "girls take action to prevent disaster".
Among the activities that Bosai Girls sponsor, are what Tanaka calls "next-generation" evacuation drills. These drills are run in trendy Tokyo neighborhoods where young people spend time. Using a special smartphone app, participants compete with each other to try to find as many evacuation centers as possible during a set period of time. The game element helps simulate the difficult experience of navigating a city during a disaster, making the drills more exciting than conventional drills.
Bosai Girls has also launched a tsunami awareness campaign called #beORANGE. When a tsunami warning siren goes off, bright orange flags are raised at evacuation centers so those in coastal areas know they must immediately run to safer, higher ground. So far, the group has given around 400 orange flags to cities and towns all over Japan. As part of the campaign, Bosai Girls even incorporated the color orange into a rope bracelet, called a "misanga". The bracelet can be used in more than ten different ways during a crisis - including as a whistle or a tourniquet. The misanga is part of the Bosai Girls' disaster accessories collection, which are practical yet fashionable products. The collection includes sturdy foldable shoes, bags covered with 3D maps of a popular district in Tokyo, and lightweight boots for disaster relief volunteers. Tanaka believes that people may be more likely to use "disaster chic" accessories than traditional, less stylish products.
Bosai Girls seems to be having an impact. Their events bring more than 3,000 attendees, and some say Bosai Girls has "changed their lives". In the future, Tanaka wants to continue increasing disaster preparedness globally. Bosai Girls to the rescue!




Making Black-and-White Photos Come Alive
World
There is something very powerful about old black-and-white photographs. They bring us to a different time and place. Yet, since we live in a world of color, black-and-white photos don't have the same authentic feel as color photos. When we look at people in black-and-white photos, they don't seem quite real; we don't feel a connection to them as we do with people in color photos.

Now, however, colorization artists are working to change this. They are adding color to historic black-and-white photos to make them come alive. "By introducing color, it helps to make it feel like it is a real piece of the past we can connect to," says colorization artist Dana Keller, from Boston, USA.

Jordan J. Lloyd, a colorization artist in London, England, speaks of an additional benefit to colorization. He explains that adding color to black-and-white photos helps viewers see old images in new ways. When there's no color, they look at the entire picture as a whole. Once color is added, viewers start noticing interesting details they might not have noticed before.

Colorization artists color photos digitally, using photo-editing software. But they don't just choose any colors. They do hours and hours of research to find out which colors are historically accurate. They look through old diaries, government records, museum artifacts, and old advertisements. They speak with history experts. 

To colorize an old photo, artists first restore the photo by fixing its cracks and scratches. Next, they add many layers of color and blend them together. "Nothing is just one color," explains Keller. (Skin, for example, can be made up of 20 different colors.) Finally, the artists adjust the colors based on how they are affected by light; they pay attention to shadows, weather conditions, and types of lighting.

Some people don't like what colorization artists are doing. They say the artists are changing, and even destroying, history. But Lloyd explains that a colorized photo is not meant to replace the original. "It sits alongside the original, but it's not a substitute." He believes that the two photos work together to tell a complete story.

Making Black-and-White Photos Come Alive
World
We live in a world of color. That's why black-and-white photos often seem strange to us, and the people in the photos don't seem real.

Photo colorization artists are trying to change this. They're adding color to black-and-white photos, to make the subjects come alive. Colorization artist Dana Keller says that colorizing a photo helps make the photo feel like it's "a real piece of the past we can connect to."

Colorization artists use a computer and special software to colorize the photos. But before they start, they need to know which colors to use. What was the color of a subject's hair, for example, or clothing? To find out what the real colors were, the artists do research. They look at diaries, objects in museums, and old ads. They speak with experts in history.

Next, the colorization artists fix the old photos by getting rid of scratches. Then, it's time to add the colors. To make each color look just right, the artists mix many different colors together. Finally, the artists look at the lighting in the pictures and make small changes. If there is a shadow, for example, the artist will make a color darker.

Some people don't want artists to colorize photos. They say it changes history. But colorization artist Jordan J. Lloyd says that colorized photos aren't supposed to replace black-and-white photos. He wants us to look at both types of photos together. This will give us a more complete picture of history, and make the subjects in the photos feel more real.

Making Black-and-White Photos Come Alive
World
Look at old black-and-white photos. Do the people in the photos look real to you? Or do they look like they're from a different world? People in black-and-white photos sometimes seem strange to us. This is because our world is full of color.

Some artists are trying to make old black-and-white photos come alive. They are adding color to the photos, using a computer.

The artists research the true colors of the people and objects in a photo. Then they add these colors to the photos. If a house was yellow, they make the house yellow. To research, the artists read diaries. They go to museums. They speak to historians. 

Some people worry that color photos will replace black-and-white photos. But artist Jordan Lloyd disagrees. Lloyd adds color to black-and-white photos. But he wants people to look at the color and black-and-white photos together. He thinks that will make history really come alive.





It isn't easy to get people to recycle. But a new project in Amsterdam, Holland, might change that. The project is called WASTED. When you recycle with WASTED, you get free products and other rewards.

How does WASTED work? First, you make an account on the WASTED Web site. WASTED digital "coins" go into this account. You put the items you want to recycle, such as plastic bottles and newspapers, in special WASTED bags. When a bag is full, you take it to a recycling container. There, you upload a photograph of the full bag to the WASTED Web site. Then, you throw the bag into the container. After you do this, you get one digital "coin". You get one coin for each full WASTED bag.

You can use your WASTED coins at more than 70 Amsterdam businesses. For example, with one coin you can get a free ice cream. You can also save money on services, like fixing your bike. WASTED is a great way to get people to recycle, and a great way to help the environment.

Getting people to recycle isn't easy. But a new project in Amsterdam, Holland, is making it easier. The project is called WASTED. It encourages people to recycle by rewarding them with free products or discounts.

How does WASTED work? First, you go to the WASTED Web site and you create a WASTED account. After creating your account, you receive 12 WASTED trash bags in the mail. These bags are for separating plastic, paper, and textiles. When a bag is full of items to recycle, you take it to the nearest recycling container. Before you throw the bag into the container, you scan a code on the bag with your smartphone. Then you upload a photograph of the full bag to the WASTED Web site. When the Web site receives this information, it puts one digital "coin" into your WASTED account. Each full WASTED bag earns you another coin.

More than 70 Amsterdam businesses accept WASTED digital coins. These businesses offer different types of rewards and discounts. For example, one WASTED digital coin can get you a free coffee or a 50% discount on bike tire repair. Thanks to the WASTED project, businesses get attention for helping the environment. This brings in new customers. Not surprisingly, new businesses are always joining the project.

WASTED has had a big effect on its participants. Almost all project users said that WASTED made them notice how much plastic they use, and 52% are now separating their plastic because of WASTED. WASTED has created a new way to get people to recycle. That's a big win for the environment.

Getting people to recycle isn't always easy, and many recycling projects fail. But a project in Amsterdam, Holland, seems to be succeeding. The project is called WASTED, and it encourages people to recycle by rewarding them with free products, or discounts at local businesses.

How does WASTED work? You simply go to the WASTED Web site and create an account. After creating your account, you receive 12 special WASTED trash bags in the mail for separating plastic, paper, and textiles. Each bag has a code printed on it, which allows the WASTED team to keep track of your recycling. When a bag is full of items to recycle, you just take it to the nearest recycling container. Before you throw the bag into the container, you scan the code on the bag with your smartphone. Then you upload a photograph of the full bag to the WASTED Web site. One digital "coin" is then deposited into your WASTED account. Each bagful earns you another digital coin. New WASTED trash bags are sent to your home for every five coins you earn.

WASTED digital coins can be used at more than 70 Amsterdam businesses. These businesses offer different types of rewards and discounts. For example, one WASTED digital coin can get you a free coffee, tea, or scoop of ice cream, a 50% discount on bike tire repair, or a 25% discount on fruits and vegetables. You can also get a discount on yoga lessons. By participating in WASTED, businesses get good publicity for helping the environment, which brings them new customers. In this way, WASTED has strengthened the connection between the people of Amsterdam and local businesses. Not surprisingly, new businesses are constantly joining the project.

A survey about the project found that 52% of project participants are now separating their plastic because of WASTED, and 23% have started buying fewer products packaged in plastic. Almost all participants said that WASTED made them more aware of how much plastic they use. By giving value to trash, WASTED has created a clever way to encourage people to recycle, and that's a big win for the environment.




How Free is "Free"?
Business
Have you ever accepted a free sample of cheese (or another food) at a supermarket? The supermarket hopes that if you like the cheese, you'll buy a whole package of it. And if it wasn't tasty? Many customers buy it anyway, even if they don't really want it! "You feel obligated to some degree," explains Professor Dan Ariely, "... [making] it more likely you buy the full package." Ariely researches behavioral economics at Duke University in North Carolina, USA. Ariely studies how and why people make decisions. He says getting an unexpected gift makes people extremely happy. This feeling of joy can make them act irrationally, however. When people have the chance to get something for free, they don't always see the downsides.
Giving away samples is just one way companies use "free" to sell products. Another way is BOGO (Buy One, Get One). Let's say you want to buy a pair of shoes. The company offers you a second pair for "free." But companies don't want to lose money, so they raise the price of the shoes in advance. And your great BOGO deal, is not so great after all.
Ads with the word "free" are all over the Internet. Many streaming services offer customers one free month of service when they pay for a subscription. If customers cancel their subscription by the end of the month, they won't be charged. Many people subscribe thinking they'll get a month of service for free, and then they'll cancel the subscription, so they won't have to pay. However, they often forget to cancel, and get charged for the service each month. So, again, the company makes money.
There are also "free" versions of gaming apps. Companies create a free, basic version of their game to encourage people to play. Then, they offer players extra features to enhance the game. Of course, these extra features cost money.
Finally, almost every "freebie" requires personal details from a customer, such as an e-mail address, so the company can send customers ads for other products. When a product is free, there's almost always a "catch." So, the next time you see an ad for a "free" product or service, think about whether or not it's actually worth it!

How Free is "Free"?

Do you like getting free food samples? Supermarkets give out samples to encourage customers to try (and hopefully buy) new products. And if the sample isn't tasty? Many customers buy it anyway! Professor Dan Ariely (from Duke University in North Carolina, USA) studied the reason for this. He explains that the surprise of getting something for "free" makes people so happy they stop thinking clearly. Then, they make irrational decisions.
Giving away samples is just one way that companies use "free" to sell products. Another way is BOGO (Buy One, Get One). Let's say you want to buy a pair of shoes. The company offers you a second pair for "free." But companies don't want to lose money, so they raise the price of the shoes in advance. While you think you're getting a great deal, you're actually paying regular prices.
Has a company ever offered to let you try their product for free? Many streaming services offer customers one month of free service when they sign up. Many customers sign up, planning to cancel their subscription by the end of the month. They often forget to cancel, however, and they end up paying each month. Streaming services know this, which is why they have the deal.
"Free" is also used by gaming apps. You can play the game for free. But there are extra features that make the game more exciting. Of course, these features cost money.
So, the next time you see an ad for a "free" product, remember to look for hidden costs or drawbacks, because "free" doesn't always mean free!

How Free is "Free"?
Business
People like to get free things. Companies like to give free things. Giving free things is good for companies. Companies make money. But are they good for customers?
Sometimes supermarkets give customers free food samples. If customers like the sample, they may buy the food. Even people who don't like the sample sometimes buy the food! Researcher Dan Ariely tells why. He says "free" makes us very happy. Then, we don't think clearly. We buy things we don't really want.
People enjoy free games on their phones. To make the games more fun, you can get extra features. These extra features cost money.
A streaming service lets people watch television and movies online. Many streaming services let you watch for free for one month. Many people sign up to watch for free. Then they plan to cancel, so they won't have to pay. But they forget to cancel, and they pay for the service.
Why do companies give you free things? "Free" makes customers spend money!





Many restaurants do food delivery. Delivery people bring food to people's homes. But now, there is a new kind of food delivery. Flying robots called "drones" bring you food! There is no pilot in a drone. A person on the ground uses a device to make the drone fly.
How does drone delivery work? First, you order your meal through an app. Then, the restaurant makes the food. Next, workers put the food inside a special box under the drone. Then, the drone flies to your house. But it doesn't land. The drone stays in the air. It sends the food down slowly, using a wire. The wire puts the bag of food down on the ground.
Delivery people travel by scooter, bicycle, or car. Sometimes there is traffic on the roads. Then, delivery people have to go slowly. But drones fly above the ground. There is no traffic! Also, cars make the air dirty. Drones are better for the environment.
In the future, maybe all restaurants will use delivery drones.

The Fastest Food
Business
A bag containing Joe Duwors' dinner just landed in his yard! "That's pretty cool," says Duwors of North Carolina, USA. Earlier, Duwors had used an app to order takeout from a local restaurant. But instead of being brought by a delivery person, Duwors' meal was brought by an autonomous flying drone! Drones are small flying vehicles with propellers. A person on the ground drives the drone using remote control.
Duwors' delivery came from Flytrex, the company that makes the drones. Each drone has a special box to hold the food. It can carry up to three kilograms. When the drone arrives at a customer's yard, doors on the bottom of the box open. The drone stays in the air, and uses a wire to carefully lower the bag of food to the ground.
There are advantages to using delivery drones. Traditional food delivery relies on vehicles, such as cars, scooters and bicycles. But these vehicles need to deal with traffic and other delays on the roads. Drones, however, fly about 60 meters above the ground. And drones don't create air pollution - like cars do - so they're more eco-friendly.
Restaurants like drone delivery because drones can make more deliveries per hour than humans. But that means fewer delivery jobs for people, which is why not everyone likes the idea of drone delivery. Also, cooks will have to work much more quickly to keep up with the drones. This may create dangerous working conditions.
The drone delivery industry continues to develop, however. So, keep checking the sky, as more and more drones will be bringing food to happy customers like Duwors!

Joe Duwors of North Carolina, USA, walks into his backyard, picks up a bag of food, and carries it into his house. "That's pretty cool," he says. Duwors' dinner has come from the sky!
Duwors received his food delivery from a local restaurant. But instead of it coming with a delivery person, it was dropped off by an autonomous flying drone. Drones are small vehicles with propellers, flown via remote control. The drone company Flytrex was responsible for Duwors' delivery. Flytrex works with US restaurant companies, serving thousands of customers in North Carolina, North Dakota, and California - and they're continuing to expand.
To get a drone food delivery, you place an order through an app. The food arrives in about 30 minutes. Each drone has a special box attached to it to hold the food. It can carry up to three kilograms, travels at about 51 kilometers per hour, and can fly approximately eight kilometers roundtrip. Upon arrival, doors on the bottom of the box open. Then, a bag of food, attached to a wire, is lowered into the customer's yard.
Traditional food delivery vehicles need to deal with traffic and other delays. But drones avoid traffic by flying about 60 meters above the ground. Delivery drones are also "greener" than conventional delivery methods. Unlike cars, drones don't create air pollution. Using drones can also help companies save money. Instead of hiring multiple delivery drivers, for example, one employee can control many drones.
But not everyone agrees that drone delivery is a good idea. Using drones means fewer delivery jobs for humans. A person can make between 2-4 deliveries per hour, while Flytrex drones can make up to 10! That also means the people cooking and preparing the food orders have to work much more quickly. And most food companies aren't increasing their number of employees or raising workers' salaries for these working conditions.
Restaurants and food companies, however, are excited about the developing industry. For now, Flytrex is one of a handful of companies offering the drone delivery service. But the industry is expected to expand quickly, with more and more drones taking to the skies, bringing food to happy customers like Duwors.




Don't Waste Food - Upcycle It!
Business
Squeeze about three oranges and you'll have a delicious glass of fresh juice. And what happens to the peels? Do they go into the garbage? Most of this food waste ends up in landfills. But now, it can be "upcycled."
Upcycling takes food leftovers that would be thrown away and uses them for the ingredients to create something new. For example, when manufacturing soy milk, coffee, or other beverages, there is organic material left over. Instead of getting rid of this material, food companies are upcycling it into snack bars, chips, cookies, and crackers. Imperfect fruits and vegetables grown by farmers provide another source of ingredients for upcycling. Grocery stores and supermarkets can't sell these "ugly" or strange-looking products, so farmers simply throw them away. But there's no need to do that anymore.
Upcycling is one of the year's biggest food business trends, with an estimated worth of $46.7 billion. Yet, despite the fact that business is booming, many people have never heard of upcycled food! A recent study found that eight in ten people would actively seek out upcycled food if they knew it were available. "Unfortunately, only 10% of consumers are familiar with upcycled food products," says Leah Graham, of the Upcycled Food Association (UFA) in the USA.
Founded in 2019, UFA lets consumers know about food upcycling. UFA has even developed a special food label. This label helps customers find the more than 400 upcycled products already available in stores. According to Graham, the special label also increases awareness of upcycled food and appeals to environmentally responsible customers.
In fact, food waste is a huge environmental issue. It takes energy and water to grow, transport, and package food - all wasted when it's thrown away. Food is also the biggest contributor to landfills. And as it rots, food makes methane, a harmful greenhouse gas that is a cause of global warming. Upcycling food keeps tons of food out of landfills.
Not only is upcycled food good for business and good for the environment, it's also good for you! Upcycled ingredients are used to make healthy products such as Renewal Mill's oat flour. One cup has much more protein than regular white flour!
So, are you ready to try upcycled food?

After you make a glass of orange juice, what happens to the peels? Most of them end up in landfills. But now, a lot of food waste gets "upcycled."
Upcycling is a way of using leftover food as ingredients to create something new. For example, companies that make soy milk and other drinks have a lot of leftover organic material. They use it to make chips, cookies, crackers, and other snacks. Supermarkets can't sell "ugly" fruit and vegetables, but they don't need to throw them away anymore.  Upcycling solves that problem!
Although the upcycling business is worth around $46.7 billion, only 10% of consumers know about it!
According to a recent study, however, eight in ten people would like to buy upcycled food - they just can't find it in stores. That's where the Upcycled Food Association (UFA) in the USA comes in.
There are already more than 400 upcycled food products, and the UFA helps consumers find them. The UFA made a special food label so the products are easy to locate. The label also tells consumers that a food company cares about protecting the environment.
Actually, food waste is a big problem for the environment. We need more and more landfills for all the waste. And the food in landfills makes a harmful greenhouse gas called methane. This gas adds to global warming. With upcycling, less food goes into landfills.
Upcycled food is also good for you! Companies turn upcycled ingredients into healthy products. For example, a company called Renewal Mill makes oat flour from upcycled ingredients. Oat flour is much healthier than regular white flour.

When a company makes orange juice, people buy the juice. But, what happens to the peels? The peels become garbage, or food waste. This food waste goes to landfills. It fills up one landfill, then another, then another. And that is very bad for the environment.
Today, food waste doesn't all go to landfills. Some companies "upcycle" food waste. That means they make something good from the waste. For example, some companies make cookies and crackers from food waste. These new upcycled foods are good for you. And they taste good too!
But there's more! Upcycling is big business! It is worth $46.7 billion! But there is one problem. Sometimes, it's hard to find upcycled foods in a store or market. So now, there's a special label for upcycled foods. The label makes it easy to find them.
There are more than 400 different types of upcycled foods. Do you want to try some?





The Empire State Building in New York City is one of the most famous buildings in the world. It is 102 floors high. From its beginning in 1931 until 1970, it was the tallest building in the world.
A company called Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) owns the Empire State Building. ESRT wanted to save money. They also wanted the Empire State Building to be "green." First, they changed all 6,514 of the windows in the building. The new windows help save energy. Then, ESRT changed over to wind power for the building's electricity. ESRT also owns thirteen other office buildings. Today, all of their buildings use wind power.
Wind power will save a lot of money and energy for ESRT. New York City has thousands of taxis. Imagine that all of the taxis stay off the streets for a year. That's now much energy wind power will save! ESRT will save about $800,000 every year from wind power. And New York City will have less pollution. That's good news and good business!

The Empire State Building - It's Good Business!

The Empire State Building in New York City is one of the most famous buildings in the world. Standing 102 floors high, it was finished in 1931, and was the world's tallest building for almost 40 years. Today, tourists ride the elevator to the 86th floor to enjoy amazing 360� views of the city.
The Empire State Building is owned by Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT). About ten years ago, ESRT took a first step to improve energy efficiency in the almost 100-year-old building. They replaced the windows with special windows that save energy - all 6,514 of them! Then, the Empire State Building began using renewable energy. Just recently, ESRT moved the other thirteen office buildings that it owns over to wind power. For the first time, all of ESRT's buildings were powered by the wind.
ESRT buys electricity from a company called Green Mountain Energy. Green Mountain Energy uses wind turbines to make electricity without creating any pollution. Powering ESRT's office buildings with wind is as good for the environment as keeping all of New York City's taxis off the roads for one year!
Changing buildings over to wind power helps the environment. However, that's only part of the story. Anthony Malkin, president of ESRT, believes using renewable energy is good business. ESRT expects to save more than $800,000 in electricity costs each year. In addition, Malkin says some companies will pay higher rents because they want to have offices in "green" buildings.
Malkin hopes that making these environmentally-friendly changes to the Empire State Building will inspire other owners to do the same. "Healthy buildings are all part of the future," he says.

Towering over New York City, at a height of 102 stories, the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, and for almost 40 years it was the tallest building in the world. Tourists to New York know their visit isn't complete without an elevator ride to the open-air observation deck on the 86th floor for its 360� panoramic view of the city. A jewel in the crown of the city's skyline, the Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings in the world.
The Empire State Building is owned by Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT). About ten years ago, ESRT began improving the energy efficiency of the nearly 100-year-old building. One way they conserved energy was by upgrading the windows - all 6,514 of them! Then, the Empire State Building started using renewable energy. Recently, ESRT took another big step in reducing the carbon footprint of the thirteen other office buildings it owns by moving them all over to wind power. For the first time, the Empire State Building, as well as all the office buildings owned by ESRT, were powered solely by wind.
Don't expect wind turbines to show up on the roof of the Empire State Building, however. That's not how it works! ESRT purchases electricity from a company called Green Mountain Energy, which converts wind from wind turbines into electricity without creating any pollution. Environmentally speaking, changing over to wind power at all ESRT properties has the same impact as keeping all of New York City's taxis off the roads for one year! Equally important, it makes good commercial sense.
There are important financial reasons for using renewable power. Anthony Malkin, president of ESRT, believes that running a "green" building is good for business. Environmentally-responsible buildings, like the Empire State Building, attract tenants who are willing to pay higher rents for space in a building with a smaller carbon footprint. In addition, ESRT is expected to save more than $800,000 in electricity costs each year.
The Empire State Building is the most famous building ESRT owns. Malkin hopes that other building owners will be inspired by the positive changes being made to this beloved landmark. "Healthy buildings are all part of the future," he says.




What Does Space Smell Like?
Business
On July 16, 1969, NASA launched Apollo 11, its first spacecraft to send astronauts to the moon. Fifty-one years later, on the anniversary of that historic event, a crowdfunding campaign was launched for a new fragrance, which brings the smell of outer space down to Earth - it's called Eau de Space.
"Are you ready for the smell of space?" astronauts at the International Space Station asked the world's first female space tourist, Anousheh Ansari, in 2006. Ansari reported that space smells "... like a burned cookie." Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield says space's "distinctive" smell is like gunpowder. Some space travelers say it has a metallic smell, while others describe it as cream of mushroom soup or fried steak. Of course, astronauts can't take off their helmets during space walks. They can only describe what they smell when they safely remove their helmets back at the spacecraft. That scent of space lingers in the particles on their spacesuits.
In 2008, NASA asked chemist Steve Pearce to create a "spacey" fragrance. Pearce developed a fragrance based on astronauts' descriptions. The idea was to use the fragrance during training, to help new astronauts get used to being in outer space. In the end, NASA never actually used the fragrance during training.
But that wasn't the end of Pearce's unique fragrance. After learning about Pearce's idea, Eau de Space's product manager, Matt Richmond, convinced NASA to release Pearce's formula. Richmond decided to use crowdfunding to raise money to produce the fragrance in the UK. So far, the campaign has raised more than $600,000! "Who knew there were so many space geeks out there like us?" says Richmond. The company's main goal is to support STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) education for students from kindergarten through high school. For every bottle of Eau de Space bought via crowdfunding, the company will donate one bottle to a STEM program in need. Using the fragrance will give students a chance to experience space - and hopefully want to visit someday. Schools can register to receive the bottle through the crowdfunding Web site.
Next, the company wants to release Eau de Luna a fragrance based on the scent of the Moon, which world renown astronaut Buzz Aldrin described as smelling "... like a fireplace."

Life today is different than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. Millions of people are staying home. This hurts companies; they can't make money. Many businesses are closing. But others are finding creative ways to stay open. For example, people stopped going to restaurants. So many restaurants started delivering food.
Ruedi Maguire is a fashion designer. He used to make beautiful dresses. But people aren't buying many dresses now. So, Maguire started making scrubs. Scrubs are special shirts and pants that doctors, nurses and other hospital workers wear.
Spiffy is a car cleaning company. During the crisis, people are driving less. So, Spiffy started cleaning the insides of buildings.
Before COVID-19, Flying Elephant Productions made furniture for big outdoor events. But  COVID-19 stopped these events. What did Flying Elephant Productions do? They saw that many people are working from home; these people need desks. So  Flying Elephant Productions now makes desks.

Why is fashion designer Ruedi Maguire creating blue, gray, and green scrubs instead of dresses? To provide special clothing for nurses and other health workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Maguire says "It's fashion with purpose, and it's amazing to be doing something that helps." Many companies around the world have closed due to the pandemic. But others, like Maguire's, are finding creative ways to stay in business.
In the past, many businesses saw their customers face-to-face. Now, customers are staying home. As a result, businesses have had to "pivot." This means taking the business in a new direction. For example, since people can't eat out, many restaurants now offer delivery and take-out services. Fitness instructors teach classes online, and real estate agents give virtual 3-D tours of homes.
The company Kidadl started as a Web site that helps people plan interesting family trips. Now, people visit Kidadl for inspiration. The site lists 1,500 free activities and ideas to help families have fun at home. Kidadl hopes that after the crisis, they will have new customers for their paid services.
Spiffy is a car cleaning service in the US. But people aren't using their cars much now. So, Spiffy pivoted, and is now sanitizing the insides of buildings.
Because of the crisis, large outdoor events have been cancelled. Flying Elephant Productions used to make furniture and signs for these events. Now, the company is helping people who need to make offices in their homes. How? They are making desks - they've sold over 1,300 so far!
As companies deal with the pandemic, there will be more pivoting. How are businesses in your area pivoting?

Ruedi Maguire is a women's wear fashion designer. But recently, he started producing a very different kind of clothing - hospital scrubs. "It's fashion with purpose, and it's amazing to be doing something that helps," says the UK-based designer, referring to health workers' increased need for protective gear during the COVID-19 crisis. Maguire is just one of the many business owners changing their products or services due to the pandemic. While many companies around the world have been forced to shut down, others are finding creative ways to stay afloat during this economically difficult time.
In the past, many businesses depended on seeing customers face-to-face. Now, with millions of people self-isolating, customers are staying home. As a result, businesses have had to "pivot," and go in another direction. For example, since people can't eat out, many restaurants now offer delivery and take-out services.
Businesses are also taking advantage of social media and video conferencing capabilities. Fitness instructors teach classes on social media. Fashion retailers and interior designers offer customers online consultations instead of meeting in a store or office. And real estate agents are offering potential home buyers virtual 3-D tours of homes.
The company Kidadl started as a Web site that helps people plan interesting trips and activities for their family. To retain their customers, they've had to pivot. Now, parents visit Kidadl's Web site for inspiration; the site lists 1,500 free activities and ideas to help families have fun while they're stuck at home. Hopefully, after the crisis, they will have old and new customers for their paid services.
Spiffy was originally a car maintenance and cleaning service in the US, whose slogan was "Imagine your car feeling new again." But people aren't using their cars much now. So, Spiffy added a new cleaning service - sanitizing the inside of buildings.
Flying Elephant Productions used to make furniture for business conferences, and exhibitions. But these types of events have been cancelled. Now, the company is turning their wood and other materials into desks for people who need to unexpectedly create home offices. So far, they've sold over 1,300 desks via a new online store!
There's sure to be more "pivots" as companies continue to search for alternative ways to keep their businesses going. What recent pivots have you noticed in your area of the globe?





Many people's finances are automated these days. Salaries go directly into bank accounts, and people spend money on hundreds of things without ever touching any actual cash. They use credit cards to shop online and pay bills right from their bank accounts. These automated systems are supposed to make life more convenient. But having everything automated can also lead to spending more money than you have, and saving money can become impossible. That's where kakeibo comes in!
Today, instead of looking for new ways to manage their money, people in Japan are trying an old one. Kakeibo (pronounced kah-keh-boh), which was developed in Japan in 1904, is a system to help you make a budget and stick to it. The word kakeibo means "household finance ledger." It was invented by Hani Motoko, Japan's first female journalist, to help busy women manage their household money - with a pen and paper, not technology.
Do you want to try kakeibo? To begin, write down your income and regular monthly expenses. Then, make one promise to yourself to help you reach your goal. For example, you might say, "I promise I will make coffee at home, instead of buying it at a caf�." As you go through the month, write down all the things you spend money on in four categories, called "pillars" in kakeibo. The pillars are needs, wants, culture, and unexpected. This helps you become more aware of your spending habits and avoid wasting money. At the end of each month, review your budget and ask yourself: How much money do I have? How much money would I like to save? How much am I actually spending? How can I improve on that?  
In 2017, writer Fumiko Chiba published the first kakeibo ledger in English. "Our world is now so fast that everything can be bought and paid for very quickly. A kakeibo helps us slow down and really consider what we buy," says Chiba. One of her tips for kakeibo success is using cash as often as you can, instead of credit cards. Chiba believes people may think twice when buying something with cash, and this helps control unnecessary spending.
 
 

Kakeibo: The Japanese Art of Saving Money
Business
Today, you can shop and bank online, and you can buy almost anything with a credit card. While this may be convenient, people sometimes spend more money than they have. And it's hard to save money.
That's why people in Japan are using a system called kakeibo to budget their money. It was invented in 1904 by Hani Motoko, Japan's first female journalist. Because the system is over 100 years old, the only thing needed is a pen and paper.
Do you want to try kakeibo? To begin, write down how much money you make each month, and things you must pay for, such as rent. Next, make one promise to yourself to help you reach your savings goal. For example, you might say, "I promise I will make coffee at home, instead of buying it at a caf�." During the month, write down everything you buy in a special kakeibo notebook. Each item goes into one of four categories: needs, wants, culture, and unexpected. Writing the information down keeps you aware of your spending, so you waste less money. At the end of each month, ask yourself: How much money do I have? How much money do I want to save? How much am I really spending? How can I do better?  
Recently, writer Fumiko Chiba published the first kakeibo book in English. "Our world is now so fast that everything can be bought and paid for very quickly," she says. "A kakeibo helps us slow down and really consider what we buy."

Kakeibo: The Japanese Art of Saving Money
Business
It's fun to spend money. But sometimes, people spend too much money. Here is one answer to the problem.
In Japan, people save money with kakeibo. Do you know what that is? Kakeibo helps people budget their money.
To do kakeibo, you need a pen and a special notebook. First, you write your salary in the notebook. What do you spend money on? Write that next. You spend money on things you need. You spend money on things you want. You spend money on culture, like concerts and movies. There are unexpected things too. It's important to write everything in the notebook. This helps you keep track of your money.
At the end of the month, you check your budget. How much did you spend? How much money do you have? How much did you save? Can you spend less next month?
Kakeibo is more than 100 years old. But people use it today. Do you want to save money with kakeibo?

Jos� Adolfo Quisocala lives in Arequipa, Peru. When Quisocala was seven, he saw many children working. The children worked instead of going to school. The children worked to get money for their families.
Quisocala wanted to help these children save money for the future. He wanted them to use some of the money to pay for school. So, when Quisocala was 11 years old, he started a bank for children. He called the bank Banco del Estudiante Bartselana.
Quisocala's bank is different from other banks. Most banks only take money. Banco del Estudiante Bartselana takes money or recyclables, like plastic bottles. The bank gives each child credit for their recyclables. Credit is like money in their account. A recycling company turns the recyclables into something new. At Banco del Estudiante Bartselana, children learn to save money and help the environment.
When Banco del Estudiante Bartselana started, it had 20 customers. Today, it has more than 2,000 customers. They are between 10 and 18 years old. Quisocala says, "Children are the hope for tomorrow."

Jos� Adolfo Quisocala, from Arequipa, Peru, remembers being seven years old. He remembers watching his friends at school wasting their money on candy and toys. They never saved it. On his way to school each day, Quisocala also saw children working to help their families earn money. Quisocala wanted to help these working children save some of this money for the future.
Quisocala thought about how to help children save money. At first - with his father's help - Quisocala looked for "child friendly" banks, where children could open a savings account. But the banks were requiring a lot of money to open an account. So, when Quisocala was 11 years old, he started his own bank, Banco del Estudiante Bartselana.
Banco del Estudiante Bartselana helps children set savings goals. Children can only take out money once they reach their goal. If a child has no money, that's OK. The bank also accepts recyclable items. Children can bring in items such as plastic bottles, used notebooks and old sandals (which are sent to a local recycling company). Each item children "deposit" turns into real money in their bank account. This way, even children without any cash can start saving. And while learning to save money, the children are also learning how to care for the environment.
When Quisocala's bank first opened, he had just 20 customers. Today, more than 2,000 children use Banco del Estudiante Bartselana. Customers are between the ages of 10 and 18. There's even a special card children can use to get money from cash machines. Quisocala has won many awards, including the Children's Climate Prize. Says Quisocala, "Children are the hope for tomorrow and our environment."

When Jos� Adolfo Quisocala was seven years old, he decided he wanted to open a bank. It would be a bank for kids in his town of Arequipa, Peru. The bank would allow the children to save money, and help them get out of poverty.
Quisocala came up with the idea when he realized that other kids in his town didn't understand the importance of saving money. Many of his classmates spent the little money they had on toys or candy. He also saw children his age working instead of going to school. They were earning money for their families. Quisocala wanted to enable these children to save some of this money for the future.
At first, Quisocala - together with his father - looked for existing banks where children could open savings accounts. But the banks required a certain amount of money in order to open an account. The amount was much too high for the kids in Arequipa.
So, when Quisocala was 11 years old, he fulfilled his dream and opened his own bank, Banco del Estudiante Bartselana. At first, the bank had 20 customers. Today, Banco del Estudiante Bartselana offers loans, microinsurance, and other financial services to more than 2,000 children between the ages of 10 and 18. The kids also have personal debit cards to withdraw money from cash machines.
Banco del Estudiante Bartselana sets savings goals, and children can only withdraw money once a goal is met. In order to make Banco del Estudiante Bartselana accessible to as many kids as possible, kids can "deposit" recyclables instead of money. Children can bring in items such as plastic bottles, used notebooks and old flip flops. This allows kids without any cash to start and grow their own savings accounts. Quisocala's "eco-bank" gives the children credit on their account according to the number of recyclables they deposit. The recyclables are then sent to a local recycling company. So, while learning to manage their money, the children are also learning to care for the environment.
Quisocala has won many international awards, including the Children's Climate Prize, which focuses on protecting the environment. He won the prize in 2018, when he was 13 years old. As Quisocala says, "Children are the hope for tomorrow and our environment."




The Gig Economy
Business
A generation ago, most people had stable 9 to 5 jobs, often staying with the same employer for many years. But a changing global economy and advancing technology are transforming the modern-day workforce. Instead of working a full-time job for a single employer, many people are working as independent contractors or freelancers, doing a collection of flexible part-time jobs. These workers are part of the "gig economy".
In a gig economy, workers do different small jobs, or "gigs", such as giving someone a ride or making a food delivery. They get paid for each separate job that they do. In many cases, their "bosses" are apps. An example is the well-known app Uber. Uber is like a taxi service, except that the drivers are everyday people who use their own cars. These gig workers earn money each time they give someone a lift. Drivers can choose when to take customers and which customers to take based on where they need to go.
Another example is Handy, an app that helps customers find a professional handyperson to perform household tasks, such as plumbing or painting. Handy gig workers choose which jobs they'll do. Some gig workers are personal shoppers. They do grocery shopping and deliveries for customers, through apps like Instacart. And with the app Airbnb, gig workers earn money by renting out their homes.
An advantage of gig work is flexibility. You get to decide what jobs you want to take and when you want to work. Gig work can also be a good option for retirees who want extra income without having to work a set number of hours each day. Gig work is also relatively quick and easy to get. You don't need a college degree, a resume, or to sit through interviews.
Gig workers do face challenges, however. As freelancers, there are no laws requiring them to receive minimum wage, nor do they receive paid vacation or sick days. They don't receive health insurance or retirement benefits either, And while some companies, like Instacart, pay workers regularly, not all companies offer steady pay schedules.
Today, approximately 150 million workers in North America and Western Europe are part of the gig economy. Can you see yourself joining them? Maybe you already have!

Some gig workers go grocery shopping for customers, using apps like Instacart. Others rent out their homes, through websites like Airbnb.
A benefit to gig work is the flexibility to choose when you want to work. Another benefit is that you don't need a college degree or resume. Gig work can also be a good option for people who want to earn a little extra money on the side.
But there are downsides to gig work, too. You don't get the benefits a full-time job gives, such as health insurance or sick days. And gig companies don't have to pay minimum wage.

Some people work full-time at one job. Other people do many separate jobs, or "gigs". They get paid for each job that they do. When people make money doing different gigs, they are part of the "gig economy".
With the company Uber, people pay you to drive them places. When you give someone a ride, you are doing a gig. You can choose how many gigs you want to do.
Are you good at doing jobs around the house? If so, you can do gigs for the company Handy. These gigs are projects in people's homes. You might paint a room, or fix a table.
With Instacart, you go grocery shopping for customers. With Airbnb, you get money when you rent out your home.
With gig work, you decide when you want to work. You decide how much you want to work. But gig workers don't get benefits like full-time workers do.
There are millions of gig workers around the world. Do you want to be one of them?

Do you shop online? Today, there are apps that make shopping online even easier. The apps have visual search engines. In a visual search engine, you upload a picture. The search engine finds other pictures online that are exactly the same, or a lot like it.
Nowadays, some businesses are using visual search engines. One example is eBay. Take a picture of an item that you like, or find a photo that is already on your phone. Upload the picture to eBay's visual search engine. The search engine finds items on eBay that are like the item in your picture. Now you can buy the item.
Pinterest has a visual search engine, too. It's called Lens. Take a screenshot of something you want, like a cool pair of shoes. Next, upload the picture onto Lens. Lens shows you where you can buy the shoes online. Then, it lets you buy the shoes. Lens also shows you what clothes look good with the shoes!
With visual search engines it's quick, easy, and fun to shop online.

You see a jacket you like. You take a picture of it with your smartphone. An app then tells you where you can buy the jacket. Apps like this one use visual search engines.
In a visual search engine, instead of typing in words, you upload a picture. The search engine scours millions of online images to find a picture like the one you uploaded. To do a search, you can either take a photo, use an image saved on your phone, or take a screenshot of an image you find online.
Businesses are starting to use visual search engines to help people shop. The online marketplace eBay is one example. Upload a photo of an item you want, and you'll get a list of the same or similar items sold on eBay.
The Web site Pinterest has a visual search tool called Lens. Lens does more than find similar images. If you take a picture of an avocado, you might get avocado recipes or tips on growing avocados. Take a screenshot of a cool pair of shoes, and you might get ideas for clothes to wear with the shoes.
Some items are hard to name or describe in words. With a visual search engine, no writing is necessary. A visual search engine can also search for out-of-stock items, so you can locate items that are hard to find. And visual search engines save you time. If you see something you like, you can buy it within minutes.
More and more visual search engines are being developed and used in business. Get ready for a new era � of "photo shopping".

Visual search engines also help businesses by giving new life to old products, by searching out-of-stock items in addition to new ones.
For customers, visual searches shorten shopping time by closing the gap between discovering an item and purchasing it. They also help consumers find items online when they can't think of the words to describe them. Visual searches can also save consumers money. Take a screenshot of an expensive item, and find out where you can buy something similar for a more affordable price.

Large cities are often trying to improve public transportation, making commuting comfortable and convenient. But while many cities have effective public transportation systems, many still have a "last-mile problem". This refers to the problem of getting to and from transit stops. For example, you may take a bus to work, but when you get off the bus, you still have a long way to go to get to the office. One way to bridge this distance, and solve the last-mile problem, is by using "dockless" electric scooters.
Recently, private scooter companies have deposited dozens of motorized scooters in large U.S. cities, such as San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The scooters are for the public to use, to get from one point in the city to another.
A smartphone app shows you where to find a scooter near you. When you locate the scooter, you use the app to unlock it and make it go. Unlike city rental bikes, the scooters don't have special drop-off and pickup stations, or "docks". So once you get to your destination, you can just leave the scooter behind, ready for the next rider. Scooter companies charge one dollar to start using the service, then fifteen cents per minute after that. Most scooters go approximately 15 miles (about 24 kilometers) an hour. That's five times faster than walking.
For some people, dockless scooters are the perfect solution. But for many others, they're a nuisance. Because the scooters can be dropped off anywhere, they are often carelessly tossed in the middle of crowded sidewalks or blocking entrances to buildings, annoying pedestrians and putting them at risk for injury. Some scooters get vandalized, becoming dangerous for riders who may try to stop their scooter only to find that the brakes have been tampered with. In addition, scooter companies pay individuals to charge scooter batteries overnight. This has given rise to a cutthroat "charging" culture, where people compete to collect as many scooters as they can.
What do you think about dockless scooters - solution, problem, or just another fad that will soon fade away?

Large cities are always trying to make public transportation more convenient for commuters. Even with improvements, however, getting to and from bus or train stops can be difficult.

Most scooters go around 15 miles (about 24 kilometers) an hour. That's five times faster than walking!
For some people, dockless scooters are the perfect solution for short trips around the city. But for many others, they're a nuisance. Because the scooters can be dropped off anywhere, riders often leave them in the middle of crowded sidewalks. They also leave them in front of buildings, blocking entrances. Besides annoying pedestrians, they can also cause injuries. Some scooters also get vandalized, which is dangerous for riders. A rider may try to stop their scooter, only to find that the brakes have been tampered with.

But many people don't like the scooters. They say they are dangerous. Some riders leave scooters in the middle of the sidewalk or in doorways. Sometimes, people trip over these scooters.

Many people like to shop. But they don't like waiting in line to pay. Now, there's a store called Amazon Go.  It has no cashiers and no checkout. So you never have to wait in line!
To shop at Amazon Go, you put the store's app on your smartphone. Then, you walk through a special gate to enter the store. You choose the items that you want. You put them in a bag. The cameras and sensors in the store watch what you put in your bag. The information goes to a computer. The computer charges your Amazon account.  Finally, you walk back out through the gate.
Later, a receipt comes to your smartphone. You also get a "trip timer". The trip timer shows you how long you shopped. One happy customer said she did all her shopping in four minutes and thirty-eight seconds!

One day, Dave Ross walked into a store, placed some snacks in a bag, and left the store without paying a cashier. "As I walked toward the exit, it felt like shoplifting," said Ross. But he wasn't shoplifting. In fact, a receipt for his items was sent to his smartphone. Dave had just visited the Amazon Go store.
Amazon Go is located in downtown Seattle, Washington, USA. It opened to the public in January 2018. Amazon Go looks like a regular store - except there aren't any cashiers. And that means no waiting in line at the checkout. Instead of shopping carts, the store gives shoppers orange canvas bags. To shop at Amazon Go, all you need is an Amazon account and a smartphone with the Amazon Go app. 
To enter Amazon Go, customers pass through turnstiles. Inside the store, there are hundreds of cameras and sensors. These devices monitor what shoppers put into their bags. Then, the items are added to a virtual shopping cart. Once shoppers finish taking their items, they simply exit the store. In addition to a receipt, customers get a special "trip timer". The trip timer shows how much time they spent shopping. "Best four minutes and thirty-eight seconds of shopping I've ever done," said one excited customer. So far, Amazon won't discuss if it's opening more Amazon Go stores.
Do you think it would feel like stealing to shop at Amazon Go? Or, would it be the best - and quickest - shopping experience of your life?

Dave Ross walked into a store, placed some snacks in a bag, and left the store without paying a cashier. "As I walked toward the exit, it felt like shoplifting," he says. "I was prepared to take off running. But no one chased me." No one intercepted Dave because he wasn't shoplifting. In fact, minutes after leaving the store, he received a receipt for his items on his smartphone. Dave had just made his first visit to the Amazon Go store.
The Amazon Go store, located in downtown Seattle, Washington, USA, opened to the public in January 2018. It had been operational since December 2016, being tested by Amazon employees. Amazon Go looks like a regular store, with one glaring exception - there aren't any cashiers. And no cashiers means no checkout lines. There aren't even any shopping carts or baskets. Instead, the store provides free, bright-orange canvas bags. To experience the world's first Amazon Go, all you need is an Amazon account linked to a credit card and the Amazon Go app on your smartphone. 
A turnstile at the store's entrance scans a code from the app. Then, customers enter the 167-square-meter space. Hundreds of cameras and sensors track shoppers, determine what they put into their bags, and add the items to a virtual shopping cart. When shoppers have finished, they walk back through the turnstile and exit the store. With their receipt, customers get a "trip timer", showing how much time they spent shopping. "Best four minutes and thirty-eight seconds of shopping I've ever done," raved one patron. 
There are some challenging aspects to Amazon Go's model, however. Opening more Amazon Go stores could mean less need for cashiers, the second-most common job in the USA. But Gianna Perini, the head of Amazon Go, explains that this isn't a problem. "We've just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience." Amazon won't yet discuss if it plans to open more Amazon Go stores.
Would you feel like a thief shopping at Amazon Go? Or would it be the best - and quickest - shopping experience of your life?

Many people today read the news online, through smartphone apps, or watch it on TV. And some still sit down with a newspaper. But a whole new type of journalism is emerging. It's called "virtual reality journalism" (VR journalism). And it's changing the way we experience news altogether.
In VR journalism, you use special headsets together with your smartphone to experience a news story firsthand, as if you were actually there! When watching a story about a hurricane, for example, you get a 360-degree view of the winds blowing and rain falling, as if you've been transported to the scene.
Major news sources, such as The New York Times, The Guardian, and CNN, have opened special VR divisions.  They've sent out Google Cardboard headsets to allow viewers to explore their VR pieces. The New York Times, for example, mailed out 1.2 million pairs of headsets.  The Guardian sent out 87,000 pairs.
One of the goals of VR journalism is to get viewers to understand what people halfway around the world - or even in the same city - are going through, and to empathize with them. The Guardian has created several VR pieces to try and achieve this goal. One piece, called "The Party", takes you into the mind of a girl with autism. Another piece, "6x9", brings you into a tiny prison cell to "experience" what solitary confinement is like for prisoners. And "First Impressions" takes you through the development of a newborn baby. As you can see, VR journalism can help people see things from a whole new perspective.
VR journalism isn't a brand-new invention. Journalist Nonny de la Pena has been producing VR stories since 2013, and is considered the pioneer of VR journalism. Her company, Emblematic Group, creates VR versions of real events. De la Pena talks about the challenges that come with this new form of journalism, such as technology issues, high production costs, and sensitivity concerns, to name a few. Yet, de la Pena is hopeful. She believes that VR journalism has the power to "evoke change" and "make people better global citizens".

Many companies are designing flying taxis. These "air taxis" will look like small helicopters. They'll carry just a few people at a time. Air taxis will be electric, so they won't hurt the environment.
Most air taxis won't have pilots! They'll be autonomous. The taxis will take off and land at special landing pads around the city. Some landing pads will be on roofs of buildings. People will order air taxis with a smartphone app.
The city of Dubai wants to have an air taxi service by 2022. They recently did a test flight of their "Autonomous Air Taxi" (AAT).  It rose 200 meters in the air and stayed there for five minutes. In the future, AATs will fly to places 30 minutes away.
The French company Airbus will use air taxis to take passengers to airports, train stations, and bus stations.
The Chinese company EHANG is putting iPads in their air taxis. Passengers will use the iPad to choose where they want to go.
Do you think air taxis will really get off the ground?

You're in a taxi on the way to the airport, but you're stuck in traffic. You wish the taxi could fly. Well, your wish might come true.
Today, many companies are designing flying taxis. These "air taxis" will lift up vertically like a helicopter. They will take off and land on landing pads around the city, and fly small groups of passengers to their destinations. Air taxis will be electric, making them environmentally friendly. They'll help make the roads less crowded.
Dubai wants to become the first city with a flying taxi service, and hopes to have one by 2022. The city recently conducted a test flight of their "Autonomous Air Taxi" (AAT), built by German company Volocopter. The AAT hovered 200 meters in the air for five minutes. Eventually, AATs will take passengers on flights of up to 30 minutes. Customers will order AATs using a smartphone app.
The French company Airbus is also developing an air taxi. Initially, their taxis will be piloted by humans, but they'll eventually be autonomous. Airbus will use its air taxis to fly passengers between airports, train stations, and bus stations.
The Chinese company EHANG is developing a one-seater air taxi. Its taxis will have iPads. Passengers will use the iPad to choose where they want to go.
Volocopter, Airbus, and EHANG are just a few of the companies in the air taxi race. And there's still a lot more work to do. Companies need to improve their taxi designs, and make sure they're safe. They'll need to make sure their taxis follow air traffic rules.

You're in a taxi on the way to the airport, but you're stuck in traffic. If only the taxi could take off, and fly you over the endless rows of cars, so you don't miss your flight! This wish may actually come true in the not-too-distant future.
Several companies are developing flying taxis. These are helicopter-like vehicles designed to transport small groups of people to nearby destinations quickly, by bypassing ground traffic.
Dubai is working hard to become the first city in the world to offer a fully operational, autonomous air taxi service. The Dubai Civil Aviation Authority recently performed a test flight of their "Autonomous Air Taxi" (AAT) built by the German company Volocopter. The two-seater aircraft lifted up vertically like a helicopter, and hovered about 200 meters in the air for five minutes. The eventual goal is for the AAT to take passengers for a flight of up to 30 minutes at a speed of 50 km/h.
Customers will order an air taxi using a smartphone app, and the AAT will arrive at the "voloport" nearest to them to take them to their destination. Dubai officials hope to have a functioning AAT service by 2022.
Another major company making strides in the flying taxi industry is the French company Airbus, which expects to have an operational service by 2023. The four-person vehicles will have human pilots at first, but will eventually be autonomous. Airbus' plan is for its flying taxis to connect major transportation hubs, so passengers can travel easily between train stations, airports, and bus stations. The taxis will fly along fixed, predetermined routes.
Chinese company EHANG is another company in the air taxi race. They are designing single-seat vehicles. These air taxis will have iPads, so passengers can choose their destination. And the list goes on...
There are still many challenges to overcome. Some involve technical design, safety standards, and air traffic rules. And air taxi companies still need to run test flights with people aboard.
A potential benefit to air taxis is that they're electric, and therefore an environmentally friendly form of transportation. They're also expected to help ease congestion on the roads. Many people have high hopes for this transportation innovation. We'll see if it actually gets off the ground.





For many people, there's nothing as tasty as their grandmothers' cooking. And sharing these homemade flavors with customers is what restaurant Enoteca Maria is all about.

At Enoteca Maria, on Staten Island, New York, you'll find grandmothers in the kitchen instead of chefs. The restaurant's owner, Jody Scaravella, thought of the concept after his grandmother, and then his mother, passed away. "Seeing an Italian grandmother in the kitchen cooking was my idea of comfort," he says. Scaravella, who grew up in New York, learned about his Italian heritage - and its culinary culture - from his grandmother, and he wanted to pass it on.

Enoteca Maria, which is named after Scaravella's mother Maria, was purely an Italian restaurant at first. Its cooks were Italian nonnas from different regions of Italy. (Nonna is the Italian word for "grandmother".) Eventually, however, Scaravella realized that people of every culture were coming to enjoy the Italian grandmothers' cooking. And he thought to himself, "How great would it be if we featured everybody's grandmother."

Today, Enoteca Maria has between 30 and 40 nonnas from around the world. Each day you'll find two nonnas in the kitchen. There is always one Italian nonna, and a second nonna from a different country, such as Japan, Ireland, or Argentina.

The nonnas decide which traditional foods will be on the menu each day. The recipes they use have been passed down through the generations. They got their recipes from their mothers and grandmothers, who got them from their mothers and grandmothers. Some of the recipes are hundreds of years old.

When dining at Enoteca Maria, you might find Nonna Rosari, from Abruzzo, Italy, cooking her spaghetti alla chitarra, or Nonna Zena preparing her mutabbal, a Syrian eggplant dip. Or perhaps you'll be served a piece of Nonna Rosa Maria's tortas de zanahoria, a Colombian carrot cake.

Both the customers and the nonnas benefit from the experience. Nonnas often leave the kitchen during the meal to interact with customers. And customers often give the nonnas a standing ovation. "I feel like I'm cooking for my family," says Nonna Rosa, from Veneto, Italy. "And that's what the customers become - my family."

Business
Many people love their grandmothers' cooking. That's why restaurant Enoteca Maria, in New York, hires grandmothers to cook the food.

Jody Scaravella, the owner of Enoteca Maria, has Italian roots. He learned a lot about Italian customs and foods from his grandmother, who often cooked Italian dishes. After his grandmother and mother died, Scaravella thought of opening a restaurant with grandmother chefs. "Seeing an Italian grandmother in the kitchen cooking was my idea of comfort," he says.

At first, Enoteca Maria only served Italian food. Each day, there were two Italian nonnas cooking food from their region in Italy. (Nonna means "grandmother" in Italian.) Yet people of all different cultures came to the restaurant to enjoy the nonnas' cooking. When Scaravella saw this, he decided to add grandmother chefs from other cultures, too.

Today, there are still two nonnas each day. One nonna is Italian. The other nonna is from a different country, such as Japan or Argentina. The nonnas get to decide what foods to serve. They use recipes that have been passed down from their mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers.

If you dine at Enoteca Maria, you might see Nonna Rosari from Abruzzo, Italy, making spaghetti alla chitarra. Or Nonna Zena from Syria might be preparing her mutabbal, an eggplant dip. Or maybe you'll get a piece of Nonna Rosa Maria's tortas de zanahoria, a Colombian carrot cake.

The nonnas often come out of the kitchen to speak with customers during the meal. "I feel like I'm cooking for my family," says Nonna Rosa, from Veneto, Italy. "And that's what the customers become - my family."

Grandmother Chefs
Business
Do you love your grandmothers' cooking?  Then go to restaurant Enoteca Maria, in New York. At Enoteca Maria, grandmothers are the chefs!

Jody Scaravella owns Enoteca Maria. Scaravella is Italian, but he grew up in New York. His grandmother taught him about Italian culture. She cooked Italian foods. When Scaravella's grandmother and mother died, Scaravella opened Enoteca Maria. He wanted to be around grandmothers. It made him feel better.

Every day there are two grandmothers, or nonnas, in the restaurant's kitchen. (Nonna means "grandmother" in Italian.) One nonna is from Italy; she cooks Italian food. The other nonna is from a different country. For example, Nonna Zena is from Syria. She makes mutabbal, (eggplant dip). Nonna Rosa Maria is from Colombia. She makes tortas de zanahoria, (carrot cake). The nonnas decide what foods to make. They use recipes they got from their mothers and grandmothers.

Nonnas also talk with customers. "I feel like I'm cooking for my family," says Nonna Rosa, from Veneto, Italy. "And that's what the customers become - my family."




Ocean Exploration for Everyone
Science & Technology
Scientists want to study the deep sea. But to study the deep sea is very expensive. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Ocean Discovery League (ODL) wants to help. The ODL's scientists made a special tool. It's called the Maka Niu. The Maka Niu only costs about $700 to make. Now, more scientists can explore the deep sea. Even people who aren't scientists can buy it. Then they can explore the deep sea too.
The Maka Niu looks like a white plastic pipe. It has a camera. It also has sensors. The sensors give you different kinds of information. The sensors check how salty the water is. They tell you how deep the water is. They also check how hot or cold the water is.
After the Maka Niu collects information, people study the information. They share it with scientists on the Internet. This helps scientists all over the world.
The ODL is making more deep-sea tools too. The Maka Niu is just the beginning!

Ocean Exploration for Everyone
Science & Technology
Some scientists study the ocean. They use cameras, sensors, and other tools. But they don't know a lot about the very deep parts of the ocean. Over 99% of the deep sea has never even been explored. This is because deep ocean exploration is very expensive. Equipment for exploring the deep sea can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, only a few countries and companies can afford it. That's why researchers at the organization Ocean Discovery League (ODL) created a new device. It's called the Maka Niu.
Researchers say the Maka Niu can be built for $700. That means that even many "ordinary" people (non-scientists) will be able to afford it. They'll be able to collect information about the ocean and share it with scientists.
The Maka Niu, meaning "coconut eye" in Hawaiian, is a white, plastic pipe that's about the size of a large flashlight. The battery-powered device has a camera, and sensors. It can check how deep and how salty the water is. It can also measure the ocean's temperature. Human divers can carry the Maka Niu with them as they explore. The device can also be lowered down into the water and brought up later. In the ocean, the Maka Niu can take pictures, and collect data. This information can then be analyzed, and shared on the Internet, for researchers worldwide to use.
The ODL recently sent 13 Maka Nius to researchers in different countries, such as South Africa, Portugal, and Bermuda. The ODL's founder, Katy Croff Bell, is excited to have them use the device. "I can't wait to see what they find and learn."

Ocean Exploration for Everyone
Science & Technology
Scientists have been exploring the oceans for many years, using cameras, sensors, and other tools. Yet today, over 99% of the deep sea has still not been studied, and remains a mystery. The reason is the cost. Few countries or companies have the hundreds of thousands of dollars it takes to develop equipment needed for deep water exploration. To solve this problem, the organization Ocean Discovery League (ODL) has developed a new device. It's called the Maka Niu, and it makes deep-sea exploration much more affordable. 
Researchers say the Maka Niu (meaning "coconut eye" in Hawaiian, and often called the "CocoCam") costs only about $700 to build. Because of its reasonable price, not only scientists, but also people in the general public, will be able to use it to collect information about the ocean. Then, they'll be able to share this information with scientists.
The Maka Niu is a lightweight, battery-powered device with a camera, GPS, and sensors. It can measure, for example, how salty the ocean is, the temperature of the water, and the water's depth. The device is a white pipe about the size of a large flashlight (261 millimeters long). It's made of a strong plastic that protects the technology inside at depths of 1,500 meters. The Maka Niu can be carried by a human diver, or weighted down to fall to the ocean floor, and be retrieved later.
Once the Maka Niu has finished doing its job, and is brought up from the ocean, the images and information it collected can be analyzed. They can then be uploaded to the Internet, to share with the worldwide scientific community.
The ODL recently sent 13 Maka Niu prototypes to researchers around the world, for free, to study the ocean. The devices went to such countries as South Africa, Portugal, and Bermuda. "I can't wait to see what they find and learn," says Katy Croff Bell, an oceanographer and the founder of the ODL. And she is excited about continuing to make deep-sea exploration tools more accessible. "Maka Niu," says Bell, "is just the beginning."





Recently, a group of scientists from Robotic Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, a Swiss research university, went hiking in the Alps. They brought their four-legged friend, ANYmal, with them. Although ANYmal walks like a dog - and moves like a dog in other ways too - it's actually an autonomous robot. The scientists wanted to see how the robot dog would handle the rough terrain on the hiking trail.
Climbing up a steep mountain, ANYmal had to navigate rocky surfaces, slippery ground, and tree roots. Despite all the challenges, however, ANYmal reached the top of the mountain in 31 minutes - faster than the average human hiker. Besides taking ANYmal hiking, the scientists tested the robot dog in a variety of other natural and urban settings. ANYmal walked up and down stairs, moved over gaps, and squeezed through tight spaces.
ANYmal robots were invented to do tasks that are unpleasant, dirty, or dangerous for humans. They can be used to inspect dangerous areas of chemical plants, for example, to make sure the equipment is working properly. ANYmal collects data using a microphone, cameras and sensors. It can sense if there is a chemical leak, for example, or locate broken equipment, and alert humans that it needs repair. ANYmal has a light, so it can work in the dark, and it's waterproof, so it can work in rain and snow.
Since ANYmal is not controlled by humans, it can enter dangerous areas alone, allowing humans to stay safe. As it encounters new environments and situations, the robot uses special technology to make its own "decisions'' about how to move. Because ANYmal works well in unfamiliar situations and on difficult terrain, it can help during and after natural disasters, such as earthquakes or forest fires. The robot can be used in search-and-rescue missions.
ANYmal isn't limited to helping us here on Earth, though. ETH Zurich scientists believe that ANYmal is rugged enough to be used on space missions to other planets. ANYmal may one day explore underground caves on Mars. And ANYmal, the robot dog, is ready for the challenge!

Robot Dogs
Science & Technology
Meet the "robot dog" called ANYmal. Like a real dog, ANYmal has four legs. It can walk, run, and crawl. ANYmal was created to do jobs that are dangerous for humans.
ANYmal can be sent to explore a dangerous area, such as a chemical plant, and collect information about it. To collect the information, ANYmal has a microphone, cameras, and sensors. If it senses a chemical leak, for example, it will alert human workers.
 
ANYmal is autonomous - it is not controlled by humans. Special technology lets ANYmal "decide" how and where to move on its own, even in new, unfamiliar places. It can also fit into tight spaces. This makes ANYmal useful during and after earthquakes or forest fires. The robot can search for people who are lost or need help. Then, it can tell the firefighters where these people are. ANYmal is waterproof too, so it can work in rain and snow.
Robotic Systems Lab in Zurich, Switzerland invented ANYmal. While developing the robot dog, scientists tested it to see how well it would work in different indoor and outdoor environments. ANYmal walked up and down stairs. It walked across wide gaps. One day, the scientists took ANYmal hiking up a mountain. There were a lot of rocks and tree roots to climb over. In some spots, the ground was slippery. But ANYmal reached the top of the mountain faster than the average human.
In addition to helping humans on Earth, ANYmal will be able to help humans explore space. There are underground caves on Mars, for example, and ANYmal is ready to investigate!

Robot Dogs
Science & Technology
Meet a "robot dog" named ANYmal. ANYmal has four legs. It can walk, run, and crawl. But ANYmal isn't a pet. ANYmal does jobs that are dangerous for humans.
One job ANYmal can do is help after an earthquake. ANYmal can find survivors. Then, the robot dog can tell humans workers where the survivors are. 
Humans don't control ANYmal. The robot dog moves on its own. It has special technology. The technology lets ANYmal know where to go.
ANYmal also has special equipment. It has a microphone, cameras, and sensors. This equipment helps ANYmal do its jobs.
Robotic Systems Lab, in Zurich, made ANYmal. The scientists tested the robot dog. They gave ANYmal tasks to do. ANYmal walked up and down stairs. It walked in rain and snow. It climbed a mountain. It climbed over rocks, and around trees.
The scientists at the Robotic Systems Lab think ANYmal can even explore Mars. ANYmal may get to Mars before humans do!





For children, hospitals can be scary. The young patients may feel worried and stressed. But Robin the Robot can help. Robin helps children in hospitals relax and feel better.
How does Robin help? Robin plays games with the children. Robin also tells stories and jokes. Robin talks to the young patients about different topics. They may talk about school, or their favorite foods. Robin can also explain to the children what treatment they are getting.
Robin is about 1.2 meters tall. That is the size of an eight-year-old child. When patients talk to Robin, they feel like they are talking to another child. But Robin doesn't look like a child. Robin's body is white plastic. Robin's head is a screen.
Expper Technologies is the company that invented Robin. The company gave Robin special technology. Robin knows when a child feels sad, angry, or worried. Then, Robin knows how to make the child feel better. Robin speaks Spanish, English, and Armenian. The robot is helping children in Armenia, the US, and other countries.
 

Robin the Robot
Science & Technology
A child in the hospital has a new friend, Robin. They talk and play games together. But Robin isn't a child. It's a robot that helps children who are getting medical treatment in hospitals or clinics.
Young patients often feel lonely, worried, or stressed. Robin helps them feel more relaxed by interacting with them. The robot plays games with the children, and tells them stories and jokes. It has conversations with the patients about different topics, such as school, their favorite food, or a medical treatment they'll be having. Robin also distracts children during these procedures. The robot can communicate in three languages - Spanish, English, and Armenian.
And Robin can do something else; it can interpret the expression on a child's face. It can tell if a child is feeling happy, sad, angry, or anxious. Then, it knows how to respond. Robin uses artificial intelligence, so the more it interacts with children the more it learns.
Robin's white, plastic body is shaped like a cone. Its "face" is a screen with two giant eyes. The robot is about the same height as an eight-year-old, so children feel like they're talking to another child. Robin has a wheel at the bottom, which lets it move in all directions.
A recent study showed that young patients felt happier after interacting with Robin. Time magazine chose Robin as one of the best inventions of the year. Robin was invented by a company called Expper Technologies. Karen Khachikyan is the CEO. How does Khachikyan describe Robin? "Robin is kind of an adorable buddy who is always there to support and help during the challenging times."

Robin the Robot
Science & Technology
An eight-year-old patient at a medical clinic in Armenia recently made a new friend, Robin. Robin and the young patient talk about different topics, such as animals. They also play games. But Robin isn't a child. Robin is a robot that provides emotional support for children getting medical treatment in hospitals or clinics.
Children receiving medical treatment often feel scared, lonely, anxious, or stressed. But Robin the Robot can help them deal with their emotions. Robin interacts with the children, reducing their stress. The robot has conversations with the children - real interactive dialogues - on all different topics. They may talk about anything, from their favorite foods to why the child is getting treatment. And Robin can explain to the child what the treatment will be like. Robin also plays games with the children and tells them jokes and stories. Perhaps most importantly, Robin distracts patients during painful medical procedures. Robin can communicate in three languages - Spanish, English, and Armenian.
Robin also has another skill. Using artificial intelligence, Robin interprets children's facial expressions. It recognizes if a child is feeling happy, sad, angry, or anxious, and responds accordingly. And the more Robin interacts with children, the more it "learns," and knows how to react next time.
Robin can move in any direction. The robot's "face" is a rectangular screen that shows two giant eyes and eyebrows. Its body is white and cone-shaped. It is 1.2 meters tall, about the same height as an eight-year-old. Because Robin is the size of a child, when children interact with it, they feel like they're with a friend.
A study at clinics in Armenia showed that young patients were happier after their interactions with Robin. "We were looking for innovative solutions, and we found Robin," says Dr. Hrachuchi Ghazaryan, the head of pediatric services at Wigmore Clinic in Yerevan, Armenia. Time magazine chose Robin as one of the best inventions of the year.
Robin is cheering up young patients around the world, and there are more Robin robots on the way. Karen Khachikyan is the CEO and founder of Expper Technologies, the company that invented Robin. "Robin is kind of an adorable buddy," she says, "who is always there to support and help during the challenging times."

Science & Technology
Scientists around the world do important research to help protect the planet. Whether studying endangered species, air quality, or new ways to conserve water, research requires collecting data. And there is a lot of data to collect, so scientists can often use help. They get this help from ordinary citizens of all ages. These volunteer "citizen scientists" don't even need to have a science degree. They gather information while doing activities they enjoy, such as skiing, hiking, surfing, or biking. Then, they share their results with scientists.
There are thousands of citizen science projects. Many focus on wildlife and the environment. Some citizen scientists measure light pollution, while others study ants or find bees. Would you enjoy biking and hiking combined with bird-watching? Then you can participate in Global Big Day, run by Cornell University, in NY, USA. During this annual event, citizen scientists look for different bird species in specific areas. Using an app called eBird, participants record the birds they see and hear as they bike and hike. They also add other information, such as where and when they saw the birds. Analyzing the data, scientists can better understand and save bird populations.
Scientists research deep inside the ocean, but areas closer to the coast are actually harder to study. That's where surfers can help! The Smartfin is a special electronic fin with sensors that can be attached to a surfboard. The sensors collect data about the surface of the ocean near coastal areas. Smartfin records the surfer's location, and can measure the water's temperature, and other important properties. The data can then be shared with oceanographers and the worldwide scientific community.
Skiers and snowboarders can also help scientists. With the Community Snow Observations project, cold-weather enthusiasts collect data on snow depth on mountains. They measure how deep the snow is, and send the location and measurements through the Mountain Hub app. The observations help scientists predict snow conditions, and improve safety for mountain travelers - by helping skiers avoid avalanches, for example. 
Citizen science allows people all over the world to work together to learn more about protecting our planet. Through these projects, citizen scientists have helped make many significant scientific discoveries.

The Mars Generation
Science & Technology
Alyssa Carson saw a children's TV show about Mars when she was three years old. She wanted to go to Mars, too! It became her dream to go to Mars.
At age seven, Carson went to space camp. She built a small rocket there. She also went on exciting video "space flights." At age nine, Carson met Sandra Magnus, a real NASA astronaut. After that, Carson knew she could become an astronaut.
Carson worked hard to reach her goal. She learned how to fly an airplane. She went underwater diving, too. Under water is a place without oxygen - just like Mars. Today, Carson is studying at university.
After university, Carson hopes to join NASA's astronaut program. But NASA only chooses the best people. One astronaut class only had 12 students! Carson knows it won't be easy.
Carson is part of "The Mars Generation" - young people who hope to walk on Mars in the 2030s. Maybe Carson's dream will come true. Maybe she will go to Mars!

The Mars Generation
Science & Technology
When she was three years old, Alyssa Carson saw a TV show about cartoon animals going to Mars. That's when Carson began dreaming of visiting Mars herself. At age seven, Carson went to her first of seven space camps. At space camp, she built model rockets. She also went on simulated space flights and learned about the history of space travel. Then, at age nine, Carson met Sandra Magnus, a former astronaut from NASA. After that meeting, Carson knew she could turn her astronaut dreams into reality.
NASA has a two-year training program for astronauts, and Carson hopes to go there. NASA only accepts people who are physically fit. They must also have an advanced university degree, so Carson is studying astrobiology at the Florida Institute of Technology. In addition, NASA wants people with experience. So, Carson learned to be a pilot. She also went skydiving to prepare for the feeling of taking off in a rocket. She trained as an underwater diver to learn about being in a place without oxygen - like on Mars. Carson even worked on a team doing research about space suits.
After university, Carson plans on applying to NASA's astronaut training program. However, it's very difficult to get in. Recently, 18,000 people applied, but NASA only chose 12! Carson knows that her excellent resume  isn't enough. "You want to have something that helps you stick out," she says. Carson hopes talking about space with her 300,000 Instagram followers will help.
Carson and a group of friends all dream of walking on Mars in the 2030s. They call themselves "The Mars Generation."

The Mars Generation
Science & Technology
When Alyssa Carson was three years old, she saw a TV show about cartoon animals going to Mars. Immediately fascinated, she spent the rest of her childhood dreaming about visiting the Red Planet. "I started watching videos of rovers landing on Mars," remembers Carson. "I had a gigantic map of Mars in my room." When she was seven, Carson attended her first of seven space camps. At space camp, she learned about the history of space exploration, built model rockets, and went on simulated space missions. The highlight for Carson, however, came when she was nine and met former NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus. Magnus inspired Carson to follow her dream of becoming an astronaut.
To reach her dream, Carson plans on applying to NASA's two-year astronaut training program after she completes her university studies. "It's actually a super competitive field to get into, and it takes a lot of hard work, but it is possible," says Carson. For a recent astronaut training class, for example, 18,000 people applied, but only 12 were chosen! Basic requirements include a master's degree and being physically fit. And NASA wants trainees with work experience, so building a resume is key.
Everything Carson does is focused on getting into the NASA program. She is studying astrobiology at the Florida Institute of Technology. She has a pilot's certificate. She trained as an underwater diver to experience being in an environment without oxygen - like on Mars. She went skydiving to prepare for the feeling of taking off in a rocket. She even participated in Project PoSSUM, an organization for space research, where she worked on a team designing space suits.

As Carson knows, in order to be chosen by NASA, you need more than the minimum requirements. According to Carson, "You want to have something that helps you stick out," so that NASA will notice you among thousands of hopeful applicants. To that end, Carson encourages an interest in space with her 300,000 Instagram followers. She is part of a group of young people who all enjoy sharing the latest developments in space exploration with their online audience. Hoping to walk on the Red Planet in the 2030s, Carson and others like her call themselves "The Mars Generation."




Up, Up and Away...to Space!
Science & Technology
Imagine yourself floating up and away from Earth. Buildings, then cities, seem to shrink below, disappearing as you rise through clouds, going higher and higher into the darkness... and you keep going... until Earth looks like a giant ball in the distance. No, it's not the opening scene of a science fiction movie. It's a real experience that will soon be available to adventurous space tourists - thanks to a company called Space Perspective. Space Perspective will take passengers on a journey into the stratosphere.
You may have heard of other companies in the growing field of space tourism, such as Blue Origin or SpaceX, that offer short trips to space by rocket. However, Space Perspective uses a gigantic hydrogen-filled balloon! Large enough to contain an entire football stadium, the huge balloon is attached to a small, bowl-shaped capsule which it pulls through space at a speed of 19 kilometers an hour. According to Jane Poynter - one of Space Perspective founders - many people are nervous about traveling in a rocket, but are less worried by the quiet, soft motion of floating with a balloon.
A journey starts before sunrise, and lasts a total of six hours. Inside the capsule, called Spaceship Neptune, there is enough plush seating for eight "Explorers," plus an area with refreshments, and of course, a bathroom. The thrill begins during the two hours it takes for the balloon to gently lift the capsule into the Earth's stratosphere - 30 kilometers above the planet. Then, passengers have two hours to enjoy floating there, taking in the magnificent, unobstructed views through the large floor-to-ceiling windows. Explorers can even share their adventure on social media from the capsule! Then, Spaceship Neptune returns to Earth, where it lands in the Atlantic Ocean and is retrieved by a ship.
Are you a future space tourist? Although Space Perspective's flight sounds incredibly exciting, most of us won't be able to afford the $125,000 ticket. And some people aren't interested in space travel at all. According to a recent poll for example, 58% of Americans say they would not go into space if given the chance. What would you choose? Taking a ride in Spaceship Neptune or keeping both feet on the ground?

Do you dream about visiting space? Space tourism companies, such as Blue Origin and SpaceX send people to space with rockets. But some people are nervous about travelling by rocket. A new company called Space Perspective has a longer, gentler space flight planned. They are using a gigantic balloon instead! A small, bowl-shaped capsule is attached to the huge balloon. Moving at 19 kilometers an hour, the balloon pulls the capsule into Earth's stratosphere - 30 kilometers above the planet!
Space Perspective's capsule, called Spaceship Neptune, has enough room for eight passengers. Passengers sit in very comfortable seats while traveling. The capsule has refreshments, and there's a bathroom, too! Each flight lasts six hours. First, it takes two hours for the balloon to lift the capsule into the stratosphere. Then, passengers have two hours to enjoy space. They can see amazing views through the capsule's large floor-to-ceiling windows. Passengers can even share their adventure on social media from the capsule! Finally, Neptune takes two hours to return to Earth. It lands in the Atlantic Ocean, and is picked up by a ship.
Are you a future space tourist? Jane Poynter is one of Space Perspective's founders. She believes that people will be excited about the experience that her company offers. But most people can't afford the $125,000 ticket. And some people don't want to go to space at all. For example, a recent poll showed 58% of Americans would not go into space if they got the chance.

Do you want to be a space tourist? Blue Origin and SpaceX are companies for space tourists. They have rockets to travel to space. Another company, Space Perspective, doesn't have rockets. It will take tourists to space with a giant balloon! Space tourists sit in a big capsule under the balloon. Eight space tourists can travel in the capsule.
What happens on a Space Perspective trip? You travel slowly up, up, up into the sky. You pass the clouds. The sky gets dark. The Earth looks like a giant ball in the sky. Now, you are 30 kilometers above Earth. You look out the windows of the capsule. It's exciting to be there! You send messages to your friends with the Internet. Finally, it's time to return to Earth. The whole trip takes six hours.
Some people want to go to space. Some people feel nervous about it. Do you want to go? A ticket on Space Perspective costs $125,000. Is it worth it? You decide!




Technology Fights Loneliness
Science & Technology
The COVID-19 quarantine is making people feel lonely. And lonely people can get sick easily, especially seniors. Now, technology is helping seniors feel less lonely.
Deanna Dezern is 80 years old. She loves talking to ElliQ. ElliQ is a small robot. The robot talks to Dezern too, and tells jokes. Dezern says ElliQ makes her feel happy.
It's hard for seniors to be inside all the time. So, the company Rendever makes VR headsets. Seniors wear the headsets. Then, they "visit" places, like the Grand Canyon.
Technology helps people stay in touch. But many seniors are afraid of technology. KOMP helps. KOMP is a screen with just one button. Seniors push the button to turn the screen on. Then, family and friends can send messages and photos to the KOMP screen. They can also video chat with the senior.
Pets make people feel less lonely. But not all seniors can have pets. So, Ageless Innovation makes robot cats and dogs. The pets look and sound real. Some seniors think they're strange. Other seniors love them!

Technology Fights Loneliness
Science & Technology
Like many seniors around the world, 80-year-old Deanna Dezern, is self-isolating during the COVID-19 crisis. Self-isolating can make people feel lonely - but Dezern feels fine. Dezern has a new companion - ElliQ. ElliQ is a small, robot made specifically for seniors. It can do many things - answer questions, tell jokes, and manage Dezern's schedule. Research shows that loneliness is bad for us. It can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease. And feelings of loneliness have gone up because of the lack of socializing during the crisis. Now, ElliQ and other types of technology are helping seniors fight loneliness.
Having less freedom to go outside or move around makes seniors feel extra lonely. But VR (virtual reality) technology can help them "travel" to other places. Rendever is a company that makes VR headsets for seniors. With the headset, seniors can visit many places in the world, including the French countryside, or Yosemite National Park.
Many seniors find computers and other devices difficult to use. KOMP, a one-button computer, solves that problem. All seniors need to do is turn it on. Then, family and friends can send messages and photos. They can also start video chats. It all appears instantly on KOMP's screen.
Ageless Innovation has special pets just for seniors. The cats purr and the dogs wag their tails. But they're not real: they're robots! The robot pets react to voices and touch. Researchers at Florida Atlantic University say these pets make seniors feel less lonely. And there's no mess to clean up!
Hopefully, companies will continue to design products to help seniors live longer, happier and less lonely lives.

Technology Fights Loneliness

"Who talks to a lamp?" jokes 80-year-old Deanna Dezern, from Florida, USA. Dezern is referring to a small robot named ElliQ, made specifically for elderly adults. ElliQ keeps them from getting lonely by acting as a companion. The robot can answer questions, tell jokes, and even remind Dezern about doctors appointments. ElliQ is just one type of robot helping older people, like Dezern, feel less lonely during self-isolation.
There is nothing new about loneliness. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, over 9 million people in the UK reported feeling lonely. But recently, due to the lack of socializing during the pandemic, the problem has gotten worse.
Research shows that loneliness and social isolation are bad for our health, leading to serious problems such as heart disease, dementia, and strokes. Now, health officials all over the world are looking for ways to fight loneliness - especially within the elderly population. And technology is here to help!
Elderly people living in nursing homes often feel isolated since they lack freedom of movement. But VR (virtual reality) technology can help reduce this feeling. Rendever is a company that makes VR headsets for senior citizens. Seniors can put on a VR headset, and use Rendever's technology to "visit" the French countryside, Yosemite National Park, or other places around the world. "All of a sudden, life is much more than the four walls around you," says Rendever's CEO, Kyle Rand.
Besides having less freedom, many elderly people don't often see family and friends. Although technology helps people keep in touch, many older people find technology intimidating. KOMP, a one-button computer, solves that problem. All that seniors have to do is turn it on. Then, family and friends with more digital skills can start video chats, or send text messages and photos, which pop up on the KOMP screen.
Ageless Innovation provides special pets for seniors. The cats purr and the dogs wag their tails - but they're not real: they're robots! Using built-in technology, the pets react to voices and touch. Researchers at Florida Atlantic University have shown that these pets decrease social isolation for older adults. And there's no mess to clean up!
Hopefully, companies will continue to design products to help seniors live longer, happier and less lonely lives.





Have you seen the viral video of a boy preparing to enter a school in China during the COVID-19 crisis? There are several steps he has to take before entering the classroom. One of these steps is walking over to a friendly-looking robot, which checks his temperature and scans his face for signs of illness. Only after passing the robot's inspection does the boy walk into the classroom.
Robots are extremely helpful during the corona pandemic because they help lower the number of humans who need to be exposed to people with the virus. And so, robots are being used in a variety of ways all around the world.
Hospitals in Europe, India, and South Africa are using robots to do various tasks instead of staff, so staff can stay at a safe distance from patients. These tasks include everything from bringing patients their food to disinfecting hospital rooms. Robots also deliver medication to patients, and bring blood samples to laboratories. The Circolo Hospital in Varese, Italy, has a robot nurse named Tommy. Tommy stands next to the beds of some patients with COVID-19. It measures the patient's' blood pressure and lets patients use its tablet to communicate with nurses and doctors remotely.
Robots are being used to support public safety, too. Police in Dubai, UAE send drone robots flying through the streets, spraying disinfectant. A robot dog equipped with a camera and loudspeaker patrols Singapore parks, encouraging social distancing by broadcasting the message "Please stand at least one meter apart!"
Robots even attended a virtual graduation at Business Breakthrough University in Tokyo. Graduates watched the ceremony live using the video-conferencing program Zoom. A few robots, who had tablets instead of faces, were dressed in traditional graduation caps and gowns. When a student was called to come and receive his or her diploma, their face appeared on a robot's tablet. So, when the robot rolled over to "accept" the diploma from the university president (who was physically there) the graduate was virtually there to accept it.
And what's another benefit to using robots in the battle against Covid-19? When a robot gets tired, you just recharge it and send it back to work!

Schools in China are using robots to check students for signs of COVID-19. Before entering the classroom, the robot checks the child's temperature and scans their face for signs of illness. But China's schools aren't the only places using robots during the corona crisis. Robots are being used in many places around the world.
Hospitals are using robots to deliver medication to patients with COVID-19, and to bring blood samples to laboratories. Some robots sanitize hospital rooms.
Tommy, a robot nurse at a hospital in Italy, stands next to the beds of some patients with COVID-19. Tommy measures the patients' blood pressure and lets patients use its tablet to communicate with nurses and doctors remotely. Hospital robots help limit the amount of direct contact doctors and nurses have with COVID-19 patients.
In the US and UK, robots deliver food and other necessary items to people in quarantine. In Dubai, robots travel around the city spraying disinfectant. And a robot dog in Singapore reminds people in parks to "Please stand at least one meter apart!"
In Tokyo, Japan, robots even helped out at a virtual graduation. A few robots - with tablets for faces - attended the graduation ceremony in place of the graduates. The graduates watched the ceremony from home, using Zoom, a video-conferencing program. When a graduate was called up to receive their diploma, their face appeared on a robot's tablet. When the robot rolled over to receive the diploma, the graduate was there to accept it virtually!
What's another benefit to using robots in the fight against Covid-19? When robots get tired, you just recharge them and send them back to work!

Corona Robots
Science & Technology
Many countries are using robots during the corona crisis. The robots do many jobs that humans usually do. Robots can get very close to people with COVID-19, so humans don't have to.
Schools in China use robots to check schoolchildren for fever. In some hospitals in Europe and South Africa, robots clean patients' rooms. They bring patients medicine.
There is a robot nurse called Tommy. Patients use Tommy to talk to doctors and nurses who are in a different room.
Robots keep people safe outside, too. In Dubai, robots spray disinfectant to clean the air. In Singapore, a robot dog walks around parks. It reminds people to stand far from each other. In the UK and US, robots bring food and other important things to people who are stuck at home.
What's another thing that's good about robots? They don't need to sleep. When they get "tired" you just recharge them and send them back to work!




Gitanjali Rao: Teenage Scientist
Science & Technology
Gitanjali Rao is a teenager. Like other teenagers, she has a lot of hobbies. Rao plays the piano and guitar. She likes swimming, baking, and writing. But this teenager also loves science. Rao uses science to invent things. She won many science prizes. Rao won a big prize for the best young scientist - "America's Top Young Scientist." The prize was $25,000!
Rao makes inventions that help people. She heard about a place called Flint, Michigan, USA. The water there was too dangerous to drink. So, Rao invented Tethys. You put your water in a glass. Is the water safe to drink? Tethys checks the water. Then, you know. Another device Rao made helps people with snakebites.
What will Rao do next? After high school, she wants to study more science. "I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people... scientists do the same exact thing," she says.

Gitanjali Rao is a teenager with lots of hobbies. She plays the piano and guitar. She loves swimming, baking, and writing. She even wrote a book called Baby Brother Wonders when she was just nine years old! Rao is also an award-winning scientist and inventor.
"I have always loved to help other people," says Rao. She started inventing things in kindergarten. One of Rao's helpful inventions can check how bad a snake bite is. She also created an app to find cyberbullying messages online. Then, Rao heard about contaminated drinking water in a town called Flint, Michigan, USA. There was too much lead (a type of metal) in the water. So, Rao created Tethys. Tethys is a small device that tests for lead in drinking water. For her invention, Rao was named "America's Top Young Scientist" by a national science competition. The prize was $25,000! Rao is using the money to make Tethys ready to be sold in stores.
Rao has done many other interesting things. Thousands of people have seen her TEDx Talks on the Internet. She travels around the USA teaching children about the dangers of bullying. And recently, she was in a special article in Forbes magazine with 29 other amazing young people.
After high school, Rao hopes to study genetics. She believes in the power of science to solve problems. "I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people, and want to do what is best for their society; scientists do the same exact thing."

Gitanjali Rao is a teenager who lives in Colorado, USA. Like many teenagers, she has lots of hobbies and interests. She is an accomplished musician who plays the piano and bass guitar. She loves Indian classical dancing, singing, swimming, and baking. She even wrote and illustrated a book called Baby Brother Wonders when she was just nine years old! She is also an award-winning scientist and inventor.
Rao became interested in science at an early age, and began inventing things when she was in kindergarten. Her parents, who are engineers, encouraged her ideas and supported her in developing and building different projects. One of Rao's inventions, which detects poisonous snake bites, won her the honor of STEM Scout of the Year. When Rao realized her school had a cyberbullying problem, she created an app to detect cyberbullying messages.
When Rao was twelve, she heard on the news that people were getting sick from drinking the water in a town called Flint, Michigan, USA. There were dangerous amounts of lead (a type of metal) in the water. Conventional water testing, which would let people know if their water was safe to drink, took too long to get results. This led Rao to create Tethys - a small, mobile device that tests for lead in drinking water. For her work, Rao was named one of "America's Top Young Scientists" by a national youth science and engineering competition, and she received $25,000 in prize money! Rao is currently using her prize money to develop and produce Tethys commercially.
"I have always loved to help other people," says Rao. She has presented her ideas in TEDx talks, which thousands of people have viewed online. Additionally, Rao recently joined 29 other amazing young people on the "30 under 30" list of Forbes magazine. She also volunteers for an organization called Children's Kindness Network. Through this organization, Rao visits elementary schools to educate children about kindness and the dangers of bullying.
After high school, Rao hopes to study either genetics or epidemiology. She believes in the power of science to solve problems. "I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people, and want to do what is best for their society; scientists do the same exact thing."





"I could feel the music all over my body," said Kassandra Wedel, an audience member at a classical music performance. Kassandra is deaf. To "hear" the music, she wore a special shirt that let her feel vibrations and other sensations on different parts of her upper body. The shirt is a piece of wearable technology, called the SoundShirt.
How does the SoundShirt work? At a concert, microphones on stage pick up the sound from the musical instruments. The SoundShirt software analyzes the music and translates the sound into data, which is transmitted to the shirt. The shirt (made of comfortable, stretchy material) has 16 sensors, which vibrate with the music. Wearers can feel these vibrations on different parts of their body. They feel violin vibrations on their arms, for example, and drum vibrations on their backs. They also feel other sensations, like waves and pulses, flowing through the shirt.
SoundShirt was created by the company CuteCircuit in London, England. CuteCircuit based SoundShirt on a wearable device they developed in 2002, called the "HugShirt," which lets you to send the feeling of a hug to someone far away. In 2016, the Junge Symphoniker Orchestra in Hamburg, Germany, approached CuteCircuit. They asked the company to invent something similar that would make concerts accessible to audience members who are deaf. CuteCircuit took on the challenge.
CuteCircuit made a prototype and had deaf audience members test the shirt and give feedback. Based on their feedback, CuteCircuit created SoundShirt 2.0. Currently, the shirt is just being sold to concert halls, museums and other entertainment venues. But soon, they'll be available for purchase by individuals too, for about $3,600.
SoundShirt 2.0 was a hit with lifestyle and culture bloggers, Hermon and Heroda Berhane. The bloggers are twin sisters and are both deaf. The company Desperados organized a huge DJ dance party, and got SoundShirts for the Berhanes to wear. "To 'feel the music' was an emotional experience for us," said the sisters. They also said that wearing the shirts made them feel more included at the party. Although the SoundShirt is expensive, the twins say it's worth it for people who are hard-of-hearing but really love music.

"To 'feel the music' was an emotional experience for us," said lifestyle bloggers Hermon and Heroda Berhane. The twin sisters, who are deaf, recently tested a piece of wearable technology, called the SoundShirt. It let them "hear" music through vibrations and other sensations.
How does the SoundShirt work? At a classical music concert, microphones pick up the sound from the instruments. SoundShirt software then turns the sound into data, and sends it to the shirt. The shirt has 16 sensors. They let wearers feel vibrations on their skin. A person feels the vibrations on different parts of their body, depending on the instruments. For example, they feel violin vibrations on their arms, and drum vibrations on their backs.
The SoundShirt was created by the London-based company CuteCircuit. They created the SoundShirt with the help of the Junge Symphoniker Orchestra in Hamburg, Germany. The orchestra wanted to make their concerts accessible to people who are deaf, so they asked CuteCircuit to make one.
CuteCircuit first made prototypes of the SoundShirt. Then, they asked people who are deaf to test the shirt and give them feedback. CuteCircuit used this feedback to develop the final product, SoundShirt 2.0. Currently, the SoundShirt is being sold to venues, like concert halls, and museums. But they'll soon be available to individuals too, for about $3,600.
The Berhanes were given SoundShirts to wear at a huge dance party. The bloggers loved them. They said the shirts even made them feel more included. And although the SoundShirt is expensive, the Berhanes think it's worth it.

Feel the Music
Science & Technology
A woman is listening to an orchestra play. But the woman is deaf.  She doesn't hear the music. She feels the music! The woman is wearing a SoundShirt. The SoundShirt makes her feel vibrations when the music is playing. When violins play, she feels vibrations on her arms. When drums play, she feels vibrations on her back. The vibrations may be fast or slow. They may be strong or weak. It depends on the music.
An orchestra in Germany wanted people who are deaf to enjoy their concerts. So, they asked the company CuteCircuit to invent a special shirt. CuteCircuit invented the SoundShirt.
How does the SoundShirt work? Musicians play musical instruments. The music travels through microphones and into a computer. Computer software sends messages to the shirt. The messages tell the shirt what kind of vibrations to make. It tells them where to make the vibrations.
Orchestras are buying SoundShirts for people in the audience. Soon, individuals will be able to buy SoundShirts too.




Save the Ice!
Science & Technology
Glaciers and icebergs are huge pieces of ice. They float in cold ocean water. But the Earth is getting very hot. The heat is melting the ice. This is dangerous for the Earth. Scientists are trying to save the glaciers and icebergs - and save the Earth.
One idea is to make new ice. Submarines will fill up with water from the sea. The water will freeze inside the submarines. Small icebergs will come out of the submarines. The small icebergs will come together to make one large piece of ice.
People living near the Rh�ne Glacier, in Switzerland, want to save it. Every summer they cover the glacier with huge white blankets. The white color reflects sunlight. So, the glacier doesn't melt.
Ice911 is an organization in the US. Ice911 makes artificial snow out of tiny pieces of glass. Scientists spread the "snow" over the ice. The "snow" reflects sunlight. Now the sun can't melt the ice.
These are just some of the ways people are saving glaciers, icebergs, and the planet.

Save the Ice!
Science & Technology
Over the years, the Earth has been getting hotter. The planet's higher temperatures have been causing glaciers and icebergs to melt - which means long-term changes to the Earth's weather. As more and more Arctic sea ice disappears each year, scientists are working on ways to save the Arctic ice.
One idea, coming from a team of Indonesian designers, is to use submarines to make new ice. First, a submarine will dive into the sea and fill up with water. Then, the water will freeze, forming (after one month) a 5-meter-thick, 25-meter-wide iceberg. The iceberg, shaped like a hexagon, will float on the water. Many of these icebergs will then come together like a puzzle, to make one extremely large piece of ice.
Another method is already being used in Switzerland to save the Rh�ne Glacier in the Swiss Alps. Each summer, as the temperature rises, people from towns near the glacier cover it with huge white blankets. The blankets' white color reflects sunlight, so the ice doesn't melt. Scientist David Volken, who studies glaciers, believes this method may reduce melting by up to 70 percent.
Ice911 also wants to protect ice from the sun. This US organization created a type of artificial snow. The "snow" is actually microscopic glass balls. When this snow is spread over water and ice, it reflects the sunlight. This protects the ice, and keeps the water cool. Researchers found that ice covered in the artificial snow stayed thicker than uncovered ice.
These are just some ways people around the world are trying to save the Arctic ice. Saving the ice means a cooler planet for us all.

Save the Ice!
Science & Technology
It's no secret that our planet is heating up. As the Earth's temperature increases, melting glaciers and icebergs contribute to climate change - long-term shifts in the Earth's weather. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic sea ice has been thinning out over the last several decades at a "catastrophic" rate. Scientists have been searching for solutions to prevent or reverse this process. A variety of techniques are being developed to save the disappearing Arctic ice.
One idea for refreezing the melting ice sounds like science fiction. A team of Indonesian designers wants to use iceberg-making submarines to create new chunks of ice at the north and south poles. First, a submarine would dive down and fill up with seawater. After filtering out the salt, the water would freeze inside the submarine (a one-month process). Finally, a 5-meter-thick, 25-meter-wide hexagon-shaped iceberg would be sent out of the submarine to float on the water's surface. The designers believe the unique shape will help many small icebergs fit together like a puzzle, to form a very large ice mass.
Another technique is being used in Switzerland to save the Rh�ne Glacier in the Swiss Alps. This method uses an unexpected item - a blanket. Each summer, as the temperature rises, a group of citizens from the nearby Obergoms area cover the glacier with enormous white fleece blankets. The blankets' white color reflects light off the glacier, protecting it from the sun's rays. Swiss glaciologist David Volken believes this technique may reduce melting by up to 70 percent.
A new invention by the US based non-profit organization Ice911 also helps keep the sun off the ice. Ice911 has created a type of artificial snow made from microscopic glass balls. The "snow" can be spread over the water and existing ice, creating slush. Sunlight reflects off the slush instead of being absorbed by the ice and sea. Ice911 has been testing their invention for about ten years, and researchers have found that ice covered in the "snow" stayed thicker than uncovered ice.
These techniques are just some of the ways people around the world are trying to restore and protect the Arctic ice. Saving the ice means a cooler planet for us all.




A Helping Hand
Science & Technology
Argentine inventor Gino Tubaro always wanted to create things to help people. "From childhood, I started to imagine what I could invent with my ideas," he says. Tubaro became interested in 3D technology and built his first 3D printer at age sixteen to print out his inventions. Today, Tubaro's organization, Atomic Labs, runs a project called Limbs, which gives free 3D printed arms and hands to people - mostly children - who need them.
Tubaro's Limbs project began when he was still in high school. Tubaro received a message on social media from the mother of a boy born with only one hand. She didn't have enough money for a new artificial hand (they can cost as much as $15,000), and asked Tubaro to print one for her son, Felipe. In 2014, following a few months of trial and error, Tubaro sent Felipe the finished hand. Then, a video of Felipe using his new hand got a lot of attention on the Internet. "Tens of thousands of people saw the video we uploaded. After, many people wanted the prosthesis," says Tubaro.
How does the Limbs project work? Anyone with a 3D printer can sign up as a volunteer on Atomic Labs' Web site. Volunteers are paired with people in their area who have requested limbs. The volunteers are sent computer files for the design they will print. Each part of the prosthesis is printed with a biodegradable printing material called PLA, usually made from corn. The basic limb design is customized for each user, and can cost as little as $15 to make. Volunteers deliver the completed limbs directly to users. Atomic Labs also organizes events called Manot�ns, where users, their families, and volunteers get together to assemble the new limb. Children often request new limbs with superhero themes. One eight-year-old who likes Wonder Woman received a red and blue hand.
Today, Limbs has 1,400 volunteers in 44 countries. More than 500 people around the world, in places such as Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Thailand, have been given new prostheses - for free. Limbs has helped people from ages four to seventy, and Tubaro is excited that Limbs continues to expand. "Imagine what you can feel if you turn someone into superhero," he says.

How does Limbs work? Limbs connects someone who needs a prosthesis with volunteers in their area who have 3D printers. Limbs sends the volunteers the computer files they will need. Then, the volunteers print the prostheses. Prostheses users get their new limbs directly from volunteers, or at Manot�ns. Manot�ns are events where users and volunteers can build a new limb together. Many children ask for a hand that will make them feel like their favorite superhero. One eight-year-old Wonder Woman fan got a red and blue hand!
 
Limbs has already helped more than 500 people from the age of four to seventy, in places such as Argentina, Brazil, and Thailand. Tubaro is excited that Limbs continues to grow. "Imagine what you can feel if you turn someone into a superhero," he says.

Some people don't have a limb - such as a hand or an arm. They must use an artificial limb. But an artificial limb, called a prosthesis, costs a lot of money. It can cost $15,000. People don't always have $15,000 for a prosthesis. That's a big problem for them.
Gino Tubaro is an inventor. He wanted to help people get prostheses. In 2014, he started making prostheses with a 3D printer. Now, he helps people get free prostheses. How? There are volunteers all over the world with 3D printers. People without a limb meet with these volunteers. Then, the volunteers print 3D prostheses for them.
Sometimes, young children need a prosthesis. They often ask for special "superhero" colors. For example, one eight-year-old girl wanted to feel like Wonder Woman. She got a red and blue artificial hand!
Tubaro is very happy about helping people get a prosthesis. He already helped more than 500 people. "Imagine what you can feel if you turn someone into a superhero," he says.




Printing a Heart
Science & Technology
People use 3-D printers to print many things. Scientists at Israel's Tel Aviv University (TAU) just printed something amazing. They printed the first 3-D heart made of human tissue!
Scientists already use 3-D printers to make simple organs. But printing a heart is harder. A heart has many different parts. Professor Tal Dvir is the scientist in charge of TAU's project. He says TAU's heart is the first printed heart with cells and blood vessels. In fact, it has all the same parts as a human heart.
Thousands of people around the world need heart transplants. But there aren't enough donor hearts for everyone. If there are printed hearts, patients will not need donor hearts.
This first 3-D heart isn't ready for humans yet. But Dvir hopes it will be ready in ten years. Then, when a patient needs a new heart, scientists will just print them one!

Printing a Heart
Science & Technology
With today's 3-D printers, we can make many different objects. We can make shoes, food, and medical devices. Recently, scientists at Israel's Tel Aviv University (TAU) printed the world's first 3-D heart made of human tissue!
Scientists have already printed some organs and simple tissues. But a heart has many different parts, so printing one is more difficult. "People have managed to 3-D print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels," says Professor Tal Dvir, the project's lead researcher. TAU's 3-D heart has all the same sections as a human heart.
According to the American Heart Association, around 120 million adults in the USA have heart disease. Many of them need a heart transplant. But there aren't enough donor hearts available. In addition, patients often need to wait six months or more for a heart, but not everyone can survive that long. 3-D hearts would solve this problem; they could be created as needed. Also, the printed heart would use tissue taken from the patient, so there's less of a chance that the body would reject it. TAU researchers say that using a patient's own tissue to "print" the heart is necessary for its success.
This first 3-D heart isn't quite ready yet. First, scientists will need to "teach" the organ to work correctly. Next, they'll need to transplant it successfully into animals. Finally, the heart will be ready for humans to try. Dvir hopes that within ten years, 3-D hearts will be replacing organ donation and saving people's lives.

What can you make with a 3-D printer? Lots of things - from shoes to food to medical devices. And recently, scientists at Israel's Tel Aviv University (TAU) succeeded in printing the world's first 3-D heart made of human tissue!
Scientists have already printed some organs and simple tissues, but printing a heart is more challenging, because it's so complex. "People have managed to 3-D print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels," says Professor Tal Dvir, the project's lead researcher. The heart needs cells and blood vessels to help it work. TAU's 3-D heart has all the same chambers and blood vessels as a human heart. The "ink" used by the 3-D heart printer came from a variety of biological molecules, and included tissues taken from human test subjects. And although this heart is small (only about the size of a rabbit's heart), Dvir says the same technology could be used to create a human-sized heart.
According to a recent report from the American Heart Association, around 120 million adults in the USA suffer from heart disease. For those with seriously damaged hearts, a transplant is their only hope. But the supply of donor hearts is limited, and patients can wait six months or more until a heart is available. Unfortunately, not all patients survive the wait. 3-D hearts would solve this problem, as they could be created as needed. And the 3-D printed heart would use tissue taken from the person having the transplant, to decrease the chances that their body would reject it. TAU researchers say that using a patient's own tissue is vital to the success of the printed heart.
This first 3-D heart isn't ready for humans - yet. During the next stages of research, scientists will have to teach the organ to "behave" like a heart, then transplant 3-D printed hearts into animals to make sure they function correctly. Finally, the hearts will be ready for humans to try. Dvir hopes that within ten years, 3-D printed hearts will eliminate the need for organ donation.




A First for Beth Moses
Science & Technology
Beth Moses returned from space awestruck. "It was just beautiful. It was the most amazing thing!" she exclaimed. The aerospace engineer had just returned from an incredible journey, becoming the first woman to fly to space on a commercial spacecraft.
"Ever since I was a child I wanted to go to space," says Moses. Her parents took her to science museums and encouraged her interest. She studied, worked hard, and became a NASA engineer. But like most people in the aerospace industry, she never actually got to be an astronaut. In a 2017 interview, Moses explained that going to space was extremely competitive and that her eyesight wasn't good enough for NASA's requirements. "I haven't gone [to space] yet, but I have my fingers crossed that I'll get to go one day."
After Moses began working at a commercial spacecraft company, space travel was finally within her reach, and she achieved her dream in February, 2019. During her historic flight, Moses and two pilots flew to a height of 89.9 kilometers. Once in space, Moses took off her safety belt and began floating around the spacecraft. She floated to the windows where she could marvel at the earth below. Then, she walked along the ceiling "like Spider-Man" to the back of the spacecraft, before eventually returning to her seat and putting her safety belt back on.
The company Moses works for is Virgin Galactic, which plans to make flights available to "space tourists". Virgin's SpaceShipTwo spacecraft, which is designed to carry six astronauts and two pilots, has more windows than any other spaceship in history, providing spectacular views. The $250,000 tickets are beyond most people's budget, but cost a lot less than the tens of millions of dollars paid by the first space tourist to the International Space Station in 2001. As Virgin Galactic's Chief Astronaut Instructor, Moses is responsible for the training customers must undergo before their flights. The firsthand encounter that Moses had in the passenger seat will help her ensure her trainees can savor their experience.
So, what advice does the 571st human to travel into space have for fellow dreamers? "Never give up, and you will achieve the impossible, and then others will follow," says Moses.

A First for Beth Moses

"It was just beautiful. It was the most amazing thing!" Beth Moses exclaimed. Moses had just returned from a historic flight as the first woman to fly to space in a commercial spacecraft.
"Ever since I was a child, I wanted to go to space," says Moses. She studied and worked hard to become a NASA engineer. However, like most engineers at NASA, Moses didn't get to be an astronaut. Then, when she began working at a commercial spacecraft company, Moses finally got her chance to go to space.
Moses's dream came true in February, 2019 while working for the spacecraft company, Virgin Galactic. Together with two pilots, she flew to a height of 89.9 kilometers above Earth. In space, Moses took off her safety belt, floated around the spacecraft, and admired the view of Earth. She also walked on the ceiling of the spacecraft before she returned to her seat and put her safety belt on again.
Virgin Galactic plans to take "space tourists" on flights in a spacecraft called SpaceShipTwo. The spacecraft can carry six passengers and two pilots. Tickets cost $250,000, but that's much less than earlier space flights. The first space tourist paid millions of dollars to visit the International Space Station in 2001.
Moses is Chief Astronaut Instructor at Virgin Galactic, and she helps customers get ready for their flights. Now that Moses has been to space, she'll use her knowledge to make the experience memorable for Virgin Galactic's passengers.

Today, Virgin Galactic is planning flights to space for "space tourists". The tickets cost a lot of money - $250,000! Before space tourists fly, Moses helps them get ready for their flight. She hopes they will also say, "It was the most amazing thing!"





Do you play virtual reality (VR) video games? Put on a VR headset, and you feel like you're inside the game. But VR can help people in other ways, too. VR can help people who have phobias, very strong fears.
There are many kinds of phobias. Some people have a fear of flying. Some have a fear of spiders. Some have a fear of dogs. Many people have acrophobia, a fear of heights.
Therapists help people with phobias. If someone has acrophobia, the therapist might have them stand on a high balcony. There, the person slowly learns to be less afraid.
Today, many therapists use VR to help people with phobias. With VR, you don't need to go to a high balcony. You just put on a VR headset. Then, it looks and feels like you're on a high balcony. But you're really in the therapist's office.
The idea to use VR for phobias isn't new. People thought of this idea 20 years ago. But now, we finally have the technology to make it work.

Have No Fear, VR is Here!
Science & Technology
Have you ever played virtual reality (VR) video games? VR creates imaginary worlds that feel completely real to the player. But VR has other uses, too. VR can help people overcome many phobias, such as fear of heights, fear of flying, or fear of dogs.
"Exposure therapy" is a common treatment for phobias. In traditional exposure therapy, a therapist slowly exposes the patient to what they fear. For example, a therapist might take a patient with a fear of heights, or acrophobia, to a balcony on a high floor of a building. There, the therapist will talk to the patient and help them deal with their anxiety.
Today, with virtual reality technology, there is a new kind of exposure therapy - VR exposure therapy. In VR therapy, instead of actually going to the balcony of a building, the patient puts on a VR headset. To the patient, it looks and feels like they're on the balcony of a tall building. But they're really still in the therapist's office.
Researchers have been exploring the use of VR with phobias for about 20 years. But only now, with advanced cell phone and gaming technologies, has VR exposure therapy become practical and affordable. And VR therapy continues to advance. Soon, people might be able to work with a virtual therapist or coach when they're doing VR exposure therapy. In a University of Oxford study, Dick Tracey, a man with acrophobia, tried VR therapy with a virtual coach instead of a human therapist. After only seven sessions, Tracey was able to stand on the roof of his house. "I would never have dreamed of doing that before," says Tracey.

Have you ever played a virtual reality (VR) game? You put on a VR headset, and suddenly, you're in an imaginary world that feels just like real life. But VR has other uses, too. VR can help people overcome phobias, such as fear of heights, fear of flying, or fear of dogs.
Phobia sufferers do everything possible to avoid situations that might trigger their phobia. This has a negative impact on their lifestyle, limiting where and how they live, work, and play. For instance, people who are afraid of dogs may avoid walking through parks, where people commonly walk their dogs.
For years, mental health professionals have been treating people with phobias using "exposure therapy". Traditional exposure therapy exposes the patient to the object or situation they fear, in a gradual way, and in a safe environment. For example, a therapist may take a patient with acrophobia, a fear of heights, to a balcony on a high floor of a building. There, the therapist supports the patient, talking them through their anxiety.

But they're actually still in the therapist's office.
Using VR to treat phobias isn't a new concept; researchers have been exploring the idea for about 20 years. But recent cell phone and video gaming technology has made VR therapy more practical and affordable than ever before. "The technology is finally catching up with the vision," says Albert Rizzo, a psychologist and VR researcher at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, USA.
As VR therapy continues to advance, human therapists may become unnecessary. In a University of Oxford study, Dick Tracey, a 62-year-old man with acrophobia, tried VR therapy with a virtual coach. After only seven VR sessions, Tracey was able to stand on the roof of his house. "I would never have dreamed of doing that before," said Tracey. "I now know how much the fear of heights restricted my everyday life."




Are You Ready for This Jelly?
Environment
You may have seen videos of jellyfish swimming in the ocean. Jellyfish are sea creatures that look like floating plastic bags, or umbrellas, with long, flowing tentacles. Jellyfish use venom in their tentacles to catch food. Lately, the number of jellyfish has been increasing in oceans across the globe. Though scientists aren't sure why this is happening, many are concerned. To them, too many jellyfish in the oceans is bad news. One interesting solution to this problem is encouraging people to eat the jellyfish!
Eating jellyfish is nothing new. For thousands of years, dishes made with jellyfish have been popular in Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Vietnam. However, in Europe and other parts of the world, jellyfish is an unfamiliar food. Biologist Antonella Leone at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) wants to change that. She says that jellyfish are low in calories and fat too, and can be a healthy addition to a person's diet. They are also a good source of protein. Out of the (approximately) 4,000 species of jellyfish worldwide, at least 30 of them are edible.
Leone has been studying jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea for more than 10 years. It's a region where the increase in jellyfish has been a huge problem. One reason is that large groups, or "swarms," of jellyfish have destroyed fish farms, causing owners to lose money. Another reason is that beaches have had to close to protect swimmers from jellyfish stings. Jellyfish stings are often extremely painful and can make humans sick; some stings can even be deadly.
Leone and other scientists at the CNR are researching ways to make jellyfish tasty. So far, they have worked with chefs to turn dried, fresh, and frozen jellyfish into appetizing foods, including desserts, salads, and seasonings. Chef Fabiano Viva, of the restaurant Duo, in Lecce, Italy, has used jellyfish in soups and pasta sauces. He's also made jellyfish taste like French fries. Leone has collected some of the chefs' best recipes so far and turned them into a book called European Jellyfish Cookbook.
And how does jellyfish taste? As one satisfied customer put it, "It tastes like the sea!"

Have you ever seen jellyfish? These sea creatures look like floating plastic bags with tentacles. The tentacles help jellyfish catch food. Around 4,000 types of jellyfish live in the world's oceans. Lately, scientists have become concerned. Many scientists believe there are just too many jellyfish. And the problem is getting worse. One interesting solution to the jellyfish problem is encouraging people to eat them!
At least 30 types of jellyfish can be eaten. In fact, eating jellyfish is already popular in Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and Vietnam. However, in many other parts of the world, jellyfish aren't considered food. Biologist Antonella Leone wants to change that. Leone has been researching jellyfish for more than 10 years. She wants more people to eat jellyfish. She adds that they are low in calories and fat, and have a lot of protein.
Leone studies jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea, where the number of jellyfish has been increasing. There, large groups, or "swarms," of jellyfish have destroyed fish farms, so the farm owners lose money. And when swarms get close to a beach, it's dangerous for swimmers. Jellyfish stings hurt! And the venom in their tentacles can make humans sick. So, many Mediterranean beaches have had to close.
To try to make jellyfish tasty, Leone works with chefs. They experiment with dried, fresh and frozen jellyfish. So far, the chefs have made soups, salads, pasta sauces, desserts, and other jellyfish dishes. Some chefs make jellyfish taste like French fries. Leone put the chefs' best recipes she found in a book called the European Jellyfish Cookbook. How does jellyfish taste? "Like the sea!" says one happy customer.

Jellyfish are sea animals. They have long tentacles. In many Asian countries, people eat jellyfish. People eat jellyfish in places like Japan, China, and Vietnam. Jellyfish are a healthy food. They don't have a lot of calories or fat. And they have a lot of protein.
In Europe, most people don't eat jellyfish. But Antonella Leone wants Europeans to start eating jellyfish. Leone is a biologist. She wants people to eat jellyfish because there are too many jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea. The jellyfish sting people in the water. (It really hurts!) So, many beaches need to close. Jellyfish also destroy fish in fish farms in the Mediterranean Sea. This is bad for businesses.
Leone wants to make jellyfish tasty. Then, people will eat it. So, Leone asked chefs to cook jellyfish. The chefs made soups, salads, and desserts with the jellyfish.

There is too much trash in the oceans. A lot of the trash is old shoes. Most shoe companies use plastic and rubber to make their shoes. These materials last a long time - too long. They take a long time to break up and go back into the environment (or "biodegrade"). Some shoes don't biodegrade at all. They just stay in the oceans and on the beaches. This is bad for the environment. But now, there is a company called Blueview. Blueview makes eco-friendly shoes.
Blueview uses plants to make their shoes. They use algae to make the bottom of the shoes. They use hemp plants and eucalyptus plants to make the top of the shoes. Because the shoes are from plants, they biodegrade quickly. But they are also strong. You can wear the shoes for as long as you want. When you are ready to throw them away, put them in a compost bin. The shoes will biodegrade in less than a year!

Goodbye Plastic, Hello Algae!
Environment
Stephen Mayfield is a biologist at the University of California, San Diego, in the USA. He researches ways to protect the oceans from plastic pollution. One cause of ocean pollution is shoes. Shoes litter beaches across the globe. In the USA alone, nearly 300 million shoes are thrown away each year. And most of these shoes don't biodegrade completely, or at all. Those that do, biodegrade slowly. So, Mayfield, along with a team of scientists, invented a shoe that is 100% biodegradable and biodegrades quickly.
The shoe company is Blueview. And Mayfield is its CEO. Blueview shoes are made entirely of plants, so they are eco-friendly. Mayfield and the Blueview scientists spent more than six years developing the sole of the shoe, which is made from algae. Next, they created a natural fabric for the top of the shoe, made of hemp and eucalyptus plants. Blueview's shoe, a flat sneaker called Pacific, comes in a several colors.
Typical shoes are made with leather, plastic, or rubber. These materials biodegrade slowly. For example, it can take 1000 years for some plastic to biodegrade. But since Pacifics are made with all natural materials, they biodegrade in less than a year! Pacifics are still strong, however, so you can treat them like any other shoes. You can even wash them in a washing machine! But when you're done with the shoes, don't throw them in the trash. Put them in a compost bin, so they'll biodegrade properly.
Mayfield is excited about the future. "If we can make our shoes the top-selling shoes in the world, every single brand will switch to this material - that is my dream."

Goodbye Plastic, Hello Algae!
Environment
Stephen Mayfield is a surfer, who's concerned for the ocean's health. He is also a biology professor at the University of California, San Diego. Mayfield researches ways to protect the oceans and our planet from plastic pollution. A lot of plastic waste comes from shoes that show up in rivers and on beaches across the globe. In the USA alone, nearly 300 million shoes are thrown away each year. And they don't biodegrade completely - or at all. Those that do biodegrade, do so very slowly. So, Mayfield, along with a team of scientists, created a plant-based shoe that's been proven to be 100 percent biodegradable. And it biodegrades quickly! The shoe company is called Blueview, and Mayfield is its CEO!
At Blueview, scientists built their biodegradable shoes from the bottom up. First, they spent more than six years developing material for the sole (the bottom of the shoe). They invented a special foam made from algae. Algae are simple plants that have no roots, and grow in water or other wet places. Next, for the top of the shoe the scientists created an organic fabric made of hemp and eucalyptus plants. The flat sneaker, called Pacific, comes in a variety of colors.
Typically, shoes are made with materials like leather, plastic, or rubber, which take a long time to biodegrade. For example, leather, a common shoe material, takes about 40 years to biodegrade. And plastic can stick around the planet for hundreds of generations. But because Pacifics are made of algae and other organic material, they can biodegrade in less than a year. Algae also absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which further reduces pollution. The scientists designed Blueview shoes to be durable, so you can treat them like any other shoe. You can even wash them in a washing machine when they get dirty! But don't simply throw the shoes in the trash when they wear out. Put them in a compost bin, so they can biodegrade properly.
Mayfield hopes Blueview shoes will also inspire other companies to use more eco-friendly materials. "If we can make our shoes the top-selling shoes in the world," he says, "every single brand will switch to this material - that is my dream."




Music Power
Environment
Imagine you're at an outdoor rock concert. Music booms through massive speakers, and lights flash over the stage. The crowd sings and moves, as the musicians perform on stage and on gigantic video screens. Performing in front of tens of thousands of people with so much equipment requires an enormous amount of power. And many bands today are trying to figure out how to power their concerts in more sustainable ways.
To produce large amounts of energy, many bands use diesel generators, which create electricity. According to a 2019 report, the UK entertainment industry uses around 100 million gallons of diesel each year to power events. But burning diesel causes pollution.
Performers are becoming aware of how their concerts affect the environment, and some are making changes. On a recent concert tour, Danish singer Lukas Graham decided to use "green" batteries. Instead of generators, he used a wind farm to charge the eco-friendly batteries before each concert. Graham doesn't miss the noisy generators or smell of burning diesel, and is excited about making concerts more sustainable.
British band Coldplay is also trying to make their concerts more environmentally friendly. They have special "kinetic" dance floors. As the music plays, fans jump and dance on these floors. Special technology converts this movement into electricity, helping to power the concert. The band also has about 15 stationary bikes, which produce energy as fans pedal. Each bike produces around 200 watts of energy. The amount of electricity generated through movement is not enough to power the whole concert, of course. But the band says their main goal is to raise awareness of the importance of creating sustainable energy.
Concerts aren't the only places where you'll see "pedal power." Rock the Bike is a company in Oakland, California, that rents out stationary bikes for various events. Their bikes are used to generate electricity for everything - from charging phones to powering blenders to make smoothies.
More and more event organizers are taking measures to make their events more sustainable, providing fun while reducing their carbon footprint. In fact, Coldplay makes sure that even the confetti they use is biodegradable. And, as Lukas Graham says, "It's the little things that make a big difference."

Music Power
Environment
Outdoor musical performances are exciting. There can be tens of thousands of fans. As the musicians play, the music comes out of huge speakers. There are large video screens and many bright lights. All this equipment uses a lot of electricity. The electricity is produced by generators. However, generators can be noisy and bad for the environment. Most generators run on diesel fuel, and burning diesel creates pollution. So today, performers are looking for more eco-friendly ways to help power their concerts.
Lukas Graham is a singer from Denmark. At a recent concert, Graham used special batteries for his equipment. The batteries weren't charged by generators. They were charged by wind turbines. Wind turbines are tall structures with blades that use wind to create electricity. Graham is proud that his concerts are becoming more eco-friendly.
The British band Coldplay is also making their concerts "greener." At Coldplay shows, fans can help create energy for the concert. They can jump and dance on "kinetic" dance floors or ride a stationary bike. Special technology converts fans' movements into electricity.
Stationary bikes aren't just for concerts, either. Many event organizers today want their events to be fun and eco-friendly. They can rent stationary bikes from companies like Rock the Bike, which can power everything from speakers to blenders, to make smoothies!
These may be small steps in the process of making events more sustainable, but as Lukas Graham says, "It's the little things that make a big difference."

Large outdoor concerts are fun. But they also use a lot of electricity. These concerts have large speakers. They have bright lights. You can see the musicians on very large screens. How do bands get all the electricity they need? They use generators. Most generators need diesel fuel to work. Diesel fuel creates pollution. But today, many musicians want their concerts to be "green." They want to find other ways to make electricity.  
Lukas Graham is a singer from Denmark. Graham doesn't use diesel generators. Graham uses a wind turbine. It turns wind into electricity. This saves a energy.
Coldplay is a British band. At Coldplay concerts, people help make electricity! How? By moving! The band has a special dance floor and stationary bikes. Fans dance on the dance floor. Other fans ride the bikes. When they move, they make energy. Technology changes the energy into electricity.
Today, more and more musicians are fans of "green" concerts.




A Different Kind of Vacation
Environment
People like going on vacation. They like to see new places and do fun things. But some people also want to help the places they visit. These travelers can take a regenerative vacation. On a regenerative vacation, you can help wild animals. You can work on a farm. You can clean up after a flood.
First Nature Treks and Tours is a travel company. They plan regenerative vacations. One vacation is in a forest in Oregon, USA. A fire destroyed a lot of trees. Now you can go to the forest and plant new trees.
Do you want to help animals? Hands Up Holidays will plan your regenerative vacation. You can go to Sydney, Australia. There, you can help kangaroos, wallabies, and wombats. You can help scientists get information about the animals. You can check to see if the water is safe for the animals to drink.
Regenerative vacations are "green." They are good for the environment. Regenerative travelers want to make the world a better place.

A Different Kind of Vacation
Environment
Are you looking for a new kind of vacation? You can try regenerative tourism. Regenerative tourism is about leaving the place you visit in better condition than the way you found it. Regenerative travelers spend their vacations improving the places they visit. They may work in areas damaged by fires, floods, or pollution. They may work on animal conservation projects, or help farmers. Regenerative tourists also meet with people from the local community. They learn about the area, and the people who live there.
One travel company offering regenerative tourism is Road Scholar. They run trips to Chincoteague Island in Virginia, USA. For one week, travelers help restore the island. This may include cleaning up beaches or building walkways. One Road Scholar regenerative tourist, Jean Carideo, helped remove harmful barbed wire from the island so it wouldn't hurt the ponies living there. Road Scholar's regenerative tourists also learn about Chincoteague Island's music and culture.
First Nature Treks and Tours is another company offering regenerative travel. They take tourists on three-day trips through Willamette National Forest in Oregon, USA. Tourists help by planting trees and fixing ruined hiking trails. After work, travelers meet with local citizens to learn about the area.
Hands Up Holidays offers many regenerative tours. On one trip, tourists go to the Blue Mountains near Sydney, Australia. They help animals, such as kangaroos, wallabies, and wombats. They may pick up fallen branches, or help researchers by collecting information about the animals.
Regenerative tourism is becoming more and more popular. "It's one thing to read, see, or hear about an ecological danger," says Carideo, "but it's another to physically do something about it."

A Different Kind of Vacation
Environment
Chincoteague Island in Virginia, USA, gets tens of thousands of visitors each year. Most come to observe and photograph the famous wild Chincoteague ponies. Tourists also enjoy exploring the island, and wandering through the shops and art galleries on historical Main Street. A few years ago, Jean Carideo went on a one-week vacation to Chincoteague Island. But instead of just watching the ponies, Carideo helped protect them. She worked for hours each day to improve the ponies' habitat by removing harmful barbed wire from the island. Carideo was taking part in regenerative tourism.
To "regenerate" means to regrow, or bring back something that was lost. Regenerative travelers actively participate in improving the place they visit, often bringing it back to the way it was. Travelers work on conservation projects, such as helping farmers, or doing restoration work in areas affected by fires, floods, and pollution. Regenerative travelers also interact with people from the community to learn about the region and its inhabitants.
Road Scholar, the travel company that ran Carideo's vacation, is one of many offering regenerative travel. Another company is First Nature Treks and Tours, which started offering three-day trips to the Willamette National Forest in Oregon, USA, after it lost 173,000 acres of trees in a forest fire. In the mornings, travelers plant trees, or restore hiking and biking trails. In the afternoons, they go mountain biking, rafting, or do other recreational activities. Then, they meet with local citizens to hear stories, and learn about the area.
With travel company Hands Up Holidays, tourists discover new places while strengthening their connection to nature. One tour takes visitors to the Blue Mountains near Sydney, Australia. For around five hours a day, participants do conservation activities to help kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, and other wildlife. They may pick up fallen branches, or help researchers by collecting data on different species in the area.
Today, more and more travel companies are offering travelers the opportunity to improve the world through regenerative tourism. "It's one thing to read, see, or hear about an ecological danger," says Carideo "but it's another to physically do something about it."




Secrets of the Seine
Environment
The citizens of Paris, "the city of love," have not always been very "loving" towards the Seine! Through the years, this famous river has become dirty and polluted. Over 2 million cubic meters of waste is dumped into the Seine every year. But 11-year-old Raphael is on a mission to help reduce the river's pollution.
Young Raphael spends most weekends "fishing" in the Seine. But he's not looking for fish � he's looking for trash! Raphael fishes metal objects out of the river. "I feel like I'm doing something for the planet in my own little way," he says.
To pull up the metal, Raphael uses a hook and a special magnet attached to a rope. The magnet can lift objects weighing up to 907 kilograms. Along with discarded bits of metal, Raphael pulls up objects like shopping carts, cell phones, scooters, and bicycles. One day, Raphael pulled a total of 20 bicycles out of the river! Another time, he found a rocket from World War II!
Raphael keeps some of the more unusual metal objects he finds, displaying them in a small museum he created in his basement at home. Examples include a camera, jewelry, and even a 19th-century bayonet! In 2021, Raphael's favorite pieces were exhibited in a pop-up museum in Paris. Raphael said he hoped the museum would raise awareness and encourage others to fight pollution.
Raphael's father, Alexandre, is not surprised by his son's hobby. "Raphael has always been close to nature and animals, so if someone does something bad to nature, like polluting it, he will, of course, step in." During the two years Raphael has been fishing in the Seine, he's removed over 18,000 kilograms of scrap metal. "At first, it was just meant to be a leisurely weekend activity," says Raphael. "But once I saw just how much debris there was buried at the bottom of the river, it became like a full-time job." In October 2020, Raphael was awarded the Medal of Paris, a prize given to people who have accomplished something significant for the city.
Raphael hopes to be one of the first to swim in the Seine once it's safe. Meanwhile, he'll continue fishing!

Eleven-year-old Raphael is on a mission. He wants to help reduce waste in the Seine. The Seine is a famous river in Paris. It is also very dirty and polluted. During his free time, Raphael fishes for metal objects people have thrown into the river.
To pull up the metal, Raphael uses a rope with a magnet and hook. The magnet can lift objects weighing up to 907 kilograms. Sometimes Raphael pulls up small pieces of metal. Other times he finds small items, like jewelry, cameras, and cell phones. But he also finds large objects, such as shopping carts, scooters, and bicycles. One day, Raphael pulled 20 bicycles out of the river! Raphael finds old objects too. He once found a weapon, called a bayonet, which was more than 200 years old!

Raphael is 11 years old. He lives in Paris. Raphael goes fishing. But he doesn't catch fish. Raphael catches metal objects!
Every weekend, Raphael goes to the Seine. The Seine is a river in Paris. The Seine is very dirty. People throw objects into the river. Many objects are metal. Raphael cares about nature. He wants to clean the Seine. So, he pulls the metal objects out of the river.
Raphael uses a magnet on a rope. The magnet is very strong. It can lift up to 907 kilograms! Raphael puts the magnet in the water. He uses the rope to pull up the metal objects.
Raphael finds small pieces of metal. He finds cell phones and shopping carts. Raphael also finds jewelry, cameras, scooters, and bicycles. Once, Raphael found a very old knife. It was from the 1800s!
Raphael took 18,000 kilograms of metal out of the Seine so far. He is happy to help the environment. "I feel like I'm doing something for the planet in my own little way," says Raphael.




Fabulous Fabric Scraps
Environment
There are thousands of fashion companies in the world. Many are in New York City, USA. The fashion companies use lots of fabric. But they don't use all the fabric. They throw away the fabric they don't need. This fabric goes into landfills. This is bad for the environment. But the company FABSCRAP is helping.
FABSCRAP gives bags to the fashion companies. The companies fill the bags with fabrics they don't need. Then FABSCRAP takes the bags.
At the FABSCRAP offices, volunteers take out all the fabric. They sort the pieces of fabric. They also take off tags, pins, staples, zippers, or buttons that are on the fabric.
FABSCRAP sells a lot of these fabric scraps. They sell the scraps in their thrift shops and online. Their prices are very low. FABSCRAP also recycles some fabric scraps. They shred the scraps. Companies can use the shredded scraps to make new things.
 
FABSCRAP was a success in New York City, So, they opened another FABSCRAP in Philadelphia, USA. Surely there will be many more.

Fabulous Fabric Scraps
Environment
New York City is known for many things, such as fashion. There are hundreds of fashion companies in the city. But making clothes makes lots of waste. This is a problem for the environment. One non-profit company is working on a solution.
When creating clothing, designers need to try many different textiles to see which work best. They cut up the textiles, but don't use them all. A lot of fabric is wasted. Then, it's thrown into landfills or burned. This harms the environment. But Jessica Schreiber thought of a plan. She started a non-profit company called FABSCRAP.
FABSCRAP collects textile scraps from hundreds of clothing companies. Then, volunteers sort and organize the scraps. They also take off any tags, pins, paper, staples, tape, zippers, or buttons. Finally, FABSCRAP either recycles the fabric or makes it available to people to reuse.
FABSCRAP sells the reusable scraps at low prices. They have an online store and thrift shops. Artists, crafters, sewers, and fashion students come to buy the scraps. And FABSCRAP volunteers receive two kilograms of free fabric as "payment" for their help. Textiles that are being recycled are shredded. The shredded fabric is called "shoddy." Shoddy can be used to fill mattresses and other products.
So far, FABSCRAP has kept almost 500,000 kilograms of used fabric out of landfills. Since they've been so successful in New York, FABSCRAP recently opened a second location, in Philadelphia, USA. And this is only the beginning. Schreiber hopes to help the whole fashion industry become more environmentally friendly.

Fabulous Fabric Scraps
Environment
New York City, USA, is one of the fashion capitals of the world. Hundreds of fashion companies call this glamorous city home. But unfortunately, lots of fashion means lots of waste. This is where FABSCRAP comes into the picture.
 
Fashion designers are constantly working with different textiles, and end up with large quantities of unused, leftover pieces of fabric. Globally, about 48 million metric tons of textiles are used to create clothing each year, and about 12% of that is wasted during design and production. Around 181,000 metric tons of fabric are thrown away in New York City alone. Most of it is burned or put in landfills.
The non-profit company FABSCRAP is working to solve this problem. FABSCRAP was founded in 2016 by Jessica Schreiber, who, while running a recycling project for New York City, saw how much fabric was going to waste.
FABSCRAP collects textile scraps from hundreds of clothing design companies. It recycles them or makes them available for individuals to buy and reuse. After signing up for the service, a company receives two kinds of bags. Brown bags are for textiles that can be reused, resold, or recycled. Black bags are for special textiles the company only wants recycled. FABSCRAP picks up the filled bags and brings them to their facilities. At FABSCRAP, volunteers sort and organize the scraps based on fiber content. They also remove tags, pins, paper, staples, tape, zippers, and buttons. Volunteers "earn" two kilograms of free fabric for their work.
The textiles that need to be recycled are shredded. The shredded material, called "shoddy," is used to make many other products, such as insulation, carpet padding, and mattress stuffing. The textiles that can be reused are sold at low prices online and in FABSCRAP's thrift shops. The shops are open to the public, making the materials available to artists, crafters, sewers, and fashion students.
So far, FABSCRAP has saved almost 500 metric tons of fabric from being thrown into landfills. And since the company was successful in New York, they recently opened a facility in Philadelphia, USA. But they're not stopping there. Schreiber wants to change the way the entire fashion industry deals with its waste.




Build Your House With Coffee!
Environment
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages on the planet, with around 10 percent of the world's coffee coming from Colombia. But to produce coffee, the coffee beans are separated from their husks, creating organic waste. In Colombia, tons of husks are dumped into landfills or burned each year; this is bad for the environment. Another problem Colombia is facing is a housing shortage. What do these two problems have in common? They are both being solved at once, by a Colombian construction company called Woodpecker. Woodpecker is using recycled coffee waste to build low-cost houses!
Woodpecker has been working on creating eco-friendly building materials for around 10 years. While developing their special lumber, they tried out different kinds of natural fibers, including rice, grass and sawdust. Finally, they chose coffee. "Coffee husk was selected because it's stronger and drier than the other fibers," says Alejandro Franco, Woodpecker's CEO.
To make their lumber, Woodpecker combines powdered coffee husks with recycled plastic. The mixture is used to form boards that look just like pieces of cut wood. Besides being durable and eco-friendly, Woodpecker's lumber is lightweight and easy to transport. This is very important because many of the people in Colombia who need housing live in rural, remote places. Building materials need to be light enough to be moved to isolated areas by small boat, helicopter, or donkey.
Once the materials arrive, it's time to start building. Most often, Woodpecker builds the homes, which can cost customers as little as $4,500 dollars. But the company also sells prefab kits, so people can build their houses themselves. The kits come with a steel frame and coffee husk lumber that fit together easily. It usually takes less than a week to construct a home. They come in different colors, and don't even need to be painted! More than 3,000 of the environmentally-friendly structures have been built in low-income areas of Colombia so far.
In the future, Woodpecker wants to add other features to its houses, including solar panels. The company also hopes to make their affordable homes available worldwide. "People, at the start, are a little skeptical that a house can be made of coffee," says Franco. But in the end, they are pleasantly surprised.

Build Your House With Coffee!
Environment
Around 10 percent of the world's coffee comes from Colombia. But coffee production is harming Colombia's environment. To produce coffee, the coffee beans are taken out of their husks. This creates tons of waste. The husks either go into landfills, or get burned. Colombia also has another problem - a housing shortage. How are these two problems connected? A Colombian company, called Woodpecker, is solving both problems at once. Woodpecker is building low-cost houses made from recycled coffee husks!
To build these homes, Woodpecker uses special boards that look like wood. But they're actually made of a building material that Woodpecker created. It's a mix of powdered coffee husks and recycled plastic. Woodpecker has been creating eco-friendly building materials for around 10 years. Before deciding on coffee, they tried mixing rice, grass and sawdust with the plastic. But coffee was the strongest material they tested.
Besides being strong and eco-friendly, Woodpecker's lumber is easy to transport. This is important because many of the people who need housing live in remote places in Colombia. The lumber is often transported using small boats, helicopters, or even donkeys, so it can't be too heavy.
Woodpecker homes can cost as little as $4,500 dollars, and they usually take less than a week to build. Woodpecker sends workers to build most homes. But they also have kits for customers who want to build the homes themselves. The lumber comes in different colors, so the houses don't even need to be painted!
In the future, Woodpecker wants to add other eco-friendly features to its houses. The company also hopes to make their affordable homes available worldwide.

Build Your House With Coffee!
Environment
Colombia makes lots of coffee. But making coffee is bad for Colombia's environment. Coffee beans grow inside a husk. Workers take the husks off the coffee beans. Then they throw the husks away. These husks make a lot of waste. Colombia also has another problem. Many people don't have homes. One company is solving both problems at once. The company is called Woodpecker. Woodpecker is using the coffee husks to make homes!
First, Woodpecker mixes coffee waste with plastic to make boards. Then they use these boards to make houses. The houses look like regular wooden houses. The boards come in different colors, so people don't need to paint their houses!
Woodpecker houses cost around $4,500 dollars. This is much less than other houses. The houses are strong and easy to build too. Workers can build a house in less than a week. You can also build your own house. Woodpecker sells kits with everything you need to make your own husk home.




Animals in the Zone
Environment
In 1986, there was a terrible accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. After the accident, there was radiation everywhere. It was very dangerous! That's why more than 300,000 people left their homes in the area. Scientists were worried.  Nothing will live near Chernobyl again, they thought.
But the scientists were wrong!
Today, the area near Chernobyl is a nature preserve. Many different animals live there. There are large animals, such as deer, horses, brown bears, boars, and wolves. Foxes and many other small animals live there too. The area has many birds, such as eagles and owls. It also has storks, swans, and other water birds.
How do we know about the animals? Scientists study them. They put special cameras inside the dangerous areas. The cameras take pictures of the animals.
Today, Chernobyl seems safe for animals. But it isn't safe for people. Some scientists say it will be safe in 3,000 years. Others say 20,000 years. That's a long time to wait!
 

Animals in the Zone
Environment
In April, 1986, there was an explosion, then fires at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine. Radiation spread over the area, and as far away as Sweden. It was the world's worst nuclear accident. More than 300,000 people from the area had to leave. Scientists didn't expect anyone or anything to survive in the area around Chernobyl. That's why "exclusion zones" - areas people weren't allowed to enter - were created. They kept people away and safe. But what about wildlife in the area?
Surprisingly, the animals around Chernobyl aren't just surviving � they're thriving! The exclusion zones are now a nature preserve - one of Europe's largest! There are many types of birds, such as eagles, owls, storks, and swans. Beavers, badgers, and foxes live there too. There are also large animals, including deer, brown bears, boars, and wolves. "It's just incredible. You can't go anywhere without seeing wolves," says ecologist James Beasley.
Beasley is one of the scientists studying Chernobyl's wildlife. Because scientists can't stay long inside the exclusion zones, they leave special cameras inside the zones to take pictures of the animals. During a five-week study, Beasley's cameras took pictures of 14 different kinds of animals!
One type of horse, Przewalski's horse, was almost extinct in the world. To save these horses, they were taken to several different places. In the 1990s, about 30 of them were brought to live near Chernobyl. Today, there are more than 150!
Scientists don't know when it will be safe for people to live in the area again. Some say 3,000 years, others say 20,000 years! But hopefully, the animals will continue to thrive.

Animals in the Zone
Environment
In April, 1986, the world's worst nuclear accident happened at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is today northern Ukraine. An explosion, followed by fires at the power plant, spread radiation throughout the region and as far away as Sweden. More than 300,000 people were evacuated, but allowed to take almost nothing with them for fear of contamination. Due to high levels of radiation, scientists predicted the area would become a "dead zone" - a wasteland where nothing could survive. They were wrong!
Amazingly, the wildlife around Chernobyl isn't just surviving - it's thriving! After the disaster, exclusion zones - areas where people aren't allowed - were created around Chernobyl, in Ukraine and Belarus, to keep people safely away from the toxic area. The zones have become one of Europe's largest nature preserves! There are at least ten species of big birds, such as hawks, eagles, owls, storks, and swans. Beavers, otters, badgers, foxes, and minks live there too. Many larger animals can be spotted, including deer, brown bears, lynxes, boars, and wolves. "It's just incredible. You can't go anywhere without seeing wolves," says ecologist James Beasley.
Beasley is one of the scientists doing research on wildlife in the exclusion zones. Because researchers have limited access to the zones, they use special equipment to gather data remotely. Drones and hidden cameras help scientists keep track of the animals. Beasley was surprised by the types of animals cameras caught during one five-week study - fourteen species, including moose, weasels, and hares!
While almost all of the animals around Chernobyl are native to the region, Przewalski's horse, a non-native species, is also thriving there. In an effort to save these horses from extinction, they were taken to several places in the world, including Chernobyl. In the 1990's, when it was considered safe enough for wildlife, around 30 horses were released into the area. Today, the herd has grown to over 150 horses!
Will it ever be safe for people to return to their homes in the Chernobyl region? Scientists estimate humans won't be able to live in the area around the former power plant for at least 3,000 years - maybe as long as 20,000! Meanwhile, hopefully, the animals will continue to thrive.




The City That�s Floating into the Future
Environment
The Maldives is the lowest country on Earth. It's a nation of 1,200 coral islands in the Indian Ocean, and not one island reaches a height of two meters above sea level! So, imagine the alarm caused there by rising sea levels and predictions that the country may be underwater in the near future. Can Maldivians stop the sea?
One bold plan to save the Maldives is to create environmentally-friendly floating islands. The first floating island, called the Maldives Floating City, or MFC, will be built soon. MFC will be inside a ring of coral reefs. It will be attached to the reefs so that it floats on top of the water. This will keep it safe, no matter how the sea level changes.
MFC is planned to cover about two square kilometers. The layout of the buildings on the island will twist and turn, giving the island a look similar to some corals. Tree-lined streets with thousands of brightly-colored low-rise houses will be connected by canals and bridges. Besides walking, people will get around MFC by boat, bike, or electric scooter - no cars allowed! Other important services, such as a hospital and a school, are part of the plans. And the best part? All of the houses will have an ocean view!
MFC has plans for tourism too. Today, the Maldives is a tourist's paradise, and thousands of visitors come for the amazing weather, white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and marine life. Because the Maldives' economy relies on tourism, there will be vacation homes on MFC, as well as hotels, restaurants, and shops. Conveniently, MFC will be close to the airport - only ten minutes away by boat.
Another major appeal of MFC is sustainability. The city will be powered by solar energy and store its own drinking water. Because cars won't be allowed, the air in this eco-friendly city will stay pollution-free. And not only won't MFC damage precious, existing coral reefs, but new reefs will be grown as well.
The Maldives government hopes that MFC will inspire other countries trying to survive climate change. "In the Maldives, we cannot stop the waves, but we can rise with them," says Mohamed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives.
 

The City That�s Floating into the Future
Environment
The Maldives is the lowest country on Earth. It's a nation of 1,200 islands in the Indian Ocean, and the highest island is less than two meters above sea level. Because of climate change, the sea level is rising. The Maldives is in danger of being under the water in the near future!
There is an exciting new plan to save the Maldives by building floating islands. The country is going to begin building their first floating island, called the Maldives Floating City (MFC), soon. It will be about two square kilometers in size and there will be coral reefs around it. They will attach MFC to the reefs, so that it floats on the water. That way, MFC will be safe when the sea rises.
There will be streets with thousands of houses on MFC, and it will have bridges and canals to connect the streets. Besides walking, people will get around MFC by boat, bike, or electric scooter - no cars allowed on this eco-friendly island! The plans also include a hospital and a school. And the best part? All of the houses will have an ocean view!
MFC has plans for tourism, too. The Maldives needs tourists, so MFC will have hotels, restaurants, shops, and everything visitors could want. And it will be easy to get there, because the Maldives' airport is only 10 minutes away by boat.
Hopefully, other island countries will learn from the Maldives and build floating islands too.  According to Mohamed Nasheed, who was President of the Maldives, "In the Maldives, we cannot stop the waves, but we can rise with them."

The Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, is the lowest country on Earth. It has 1,200 very low coral islands. They are less than two meters above sea level! Because of climate change, the sea level is rising. Will the Maldives be under the sea in the near future?
There is a plan to save the Maldives. The country is going to build islands that float. The first island is called the Maldives Floating City, or MFC. MFC will be about two square kilometers. It will have thousands of houses and other buildings. There will be shops, restaurants, a hospital, and a school. For tourists, there will be hotels. And MFC will be close to the Maldives' airport - only ten minutes by boat.
MFC will be eco-friendly. People will walk around the city or ride bikes and electric scooters - no cars allowed! There will also be bridges and canals to go from street to street.
People in the Maldives hope floating islands will save their country.




Quiet the Seas, Please!
Environment
It's very noisy under the sea. Marine animals make noise. Wind, rain, and waves make noise too. These ocean sounds come from nature. But some ocean sounds come from people. People build by the sea. They drill for oil. They take things from place to place in large ships. They do loud sports, like water skiing. All of these activities make noise pollution.
Underwater noise pollution is a big problem for marine animals. Because of noise pollution, they can't hear the ocean's natural sounds. Sea animals use natural sounds to find food, and stay safe. Sounds give them other important information too. For example, some fish use sounds to find their way home. Blue whales call to each other from kilometers away. Sounds help marine animals survive.
There are some easy ways to fix underwater noise pollution. Slow ships make less noise than fast ships. Special "curtains" stop noises that come from building by the sea. Let's get started. It's time to stop noise pollution in the sea!

Quiet the Seas, Please!
Environment
Do you enjoy the ocean? It may seem like the world under the ocean is peaceful and silent. In fact, it's very busy and noisy.
Sound is very important for animals living in the water. They use sound to communicate, find food, and stay safe. For example, a female blue whale can hear a male's sounds from thousands of kilometers away. Baby clown fish float in the ocean until they hear noises from reefs that are far away. The noises guide them "home" to the reef. So, what happens to marine animals when they can't hear these sounds?
The ocean has natural sounds from waves, wind, and rain. Sea animals also make noise. The problem is human noise, caused by shipping, building, and drilling for oil. Water sports and other activities add to the noise. All this human noise pollution is a dangerous threat to sea life. "We've silenced the soundtrack of the healthy ocean and replaced it with the sound that we create," says marine scientist Dr. Carlos Duarte.
Some problems, like higher water temperatures and plastic pollution, are difficult to solve. According to Duarte, however, fixing noise pollution is easy: just turn off the noise! How do we know it will work? In April 2020, 60% of the world's population was in some kind of lockdown due to COVID-19. During that time, research showed that ocean noise went down by 20%.
Meanwhile, solutions to the noise problem already exist. Special "curtains" can stop noise from building by the sea. Special propellers can make ships quieter. Just making ships travel more slowly would help too. The question is: what are we waiting for?

Quiet the Seas, Please!
Environment
You're floating on your back in the ocean, the sun warming your face, while a gentle breeze passes over you. You hear the far-off sound of small waves reaching the shore, and a seagull calls out as it flies by. All is peaceful. The ocean seems like a giant, almost-silent paradise. Under the surface, however, it's a busy, noisy world of life and sound.

In the ocean, sound is as important as light is to those of us who live above water. Marine animals use sound to communicate, navigate, locate food, avoid predators, and find mates. For many underwater animals, sound is life. A female blue whale can hear mating calls from a male thousands of kilometers away. Baby clown fish, floating in the open ocean, use distant reef noises to find their way "home" to the reef where they will spend their lives. The question is, what happens to marine animals when they can't hear these extremely important sounds?
Natural ocean sounds come from wind, waves, rain, and even underwater earthquakes. Creatures that live in the sea add to the noisy environment. However, in the last century, human activity has brought terrible noise pollution to the oceans. Construction along the coast, shipping, commercial fishing, drilling for oil, and recreational activities - to name just a few human activities - are a deadly threat to our oceans. "We've silenced the soundtrack of the healthy ocean and replaced it with the sound that we create," says marine scientist Dr. Carlos Duarte.
When stress caused by noise pollution is added to other threats, sea life doesn't stand a chance. Some problems - like rising water temperatures and pollutants entering the ocean - are difficult problems to solve. Reducing noise pollution, however, is a different story. "The moment we switch our noise off," Duarte says, "the impact disappears." How do we know? In April 2020, when 60% of the world's population was in some form of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, research that showed ocean noise went down by 20%.
Many solutions to the problem already exist, such as noise-reducing propellers and "bubble curtains" that prevent construction noise. Simply reducing the speed that ships travel would have a big effect too. So, if solutions exist, what are we waiting for?




Do Birds Sing in the City?
Environment
Birds don't just inspire humans and stimulate our imaginations - they help make cities more harmonious. Birds eat insects, pollinate plants, and thrill us with their songs. They are part of the city's natural environment, which experts say gives people the benefits of reducing stress, improving health, and increasing feelings of well-being. Unfortunately, however, cities are full of dangers for birds.
"There are many things we can and must do to make our cities more bird-friendly," says Timothy Beatley. A professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture, Beatley wrote a book called The Bird-Friendly City. In it, he discusses creative solutions, showing the changes cities need to make in order to have happy, healthy birds. Where to start? Tall buildings.
Until recently, most medium-to-tall buildings in cities weren't designed for bird safety. Glass windows and mirror-like surfaces are hazards for birds because they reflect trees and sky. Birds mistake them for their natural environment, and they fly right into them! These collisions kill hundreds of millions of birds each year. And birds migrating through a city at night are drawn to buildings' lights, causing more fatal collisions. But buildings can be designed to be safer for birds. For example, the less glass used to construct the outside of a building, the better. And instead of being smooth, all glass should have a pattern which helps birds recognize the danger and avoid it. To keep birds away from buildings at night, automatic controls can turn off the interior lights.
In addition to keeping birds safe, some cities - such as New York and London - are trying to attract different types of birds. They've created areas of trees and plants across the city to form a "green corridor." Birds and other wildlife are enticed by the greenery where they can rest, feed, and breed. Scientists say that having a range of animal species in an area strengthens the ecosystem, helping birds survive. Recently, thanks to London's green corridor, some rare species have returned to the center of the crowded city.
"Birds have brought a lot of joy and meaning to my life," says Beatley. But more than that, helping city birds thrive is as important for our future as it is for theirs.

Do Birds Sing in the City?
Environment
Even in noisy, crowded cities, people enjoy the beautiful songs of birds. Birds are part of a city's natural environment, eating insects and pollinating plants. Experts say having nature in cities improves people's general health and happiness. That's why birds are good for people in cities. However, cities can be dangerous for birds.
Tall buildings are one of the biggest dangers to birds in cities. Tall buildings have many windows and other smooth glass surfaces. Glass reflects sky and trees which birds think are real, so they don't try to keep away from the glass. They fly right into it! Also, the many lights inside these tall buildings attract birds when they fly through a city at night. Every year, hundreds of millions of birds die by crashing into buildings.
According to Timothy Beatley, a professor who wrote a book called The Bird-Friendly City, we need to design buildings that keep birds safe. Buildings with less glass are safer for birds. Glass surfaces with a pattern are safer too, because patterns help birds recognize the danger, and stay away. To protect birds at night, a building's lights can be programmed to turn off automatically.
Some cities, such as New York and London, want to attract more and different types of birds. They have created small areas of trees and plants across the city. Birds and other animals come to rest, eat, and breed in these lovely green spots. Scientists say having different kinds of animals together in an area is good for the city's ecosystem - including the birds!
What are cities in your country doing to keep your birds safe?

Do Birds Sing in the City?
Environment
People in cities need nature. Nature makes us healthy and happy. That's why birds are important. They are part of nature. They fly in the sky. They sing beautiful songs. And we feel happy.
In some cities, there are special places for birds. London and New York have areas with plants and trees for their birds. Different kinds of birds come to live in these green areas. Other animals come to these green areas, too. That's good for the animals, the birds, and the people.
Unfortunately, cities are also dangerous for birds. Hundreds of millions of birds die in cities every year. One reason is the tall buildings. They have a lot of windows and other glass. Birds don't see the glass. They fly into the glass... and die.
Luckily, we can make buildings safer for birds. Windows with special glass can save many birds. We can also turn off lights in buildings at night. Why? Because birds fly to the lights and crash into the buildings.
Let's all try to save our birds!





Many animals in the world are endangered. Scientists try to help endangered animals. Sometimes they use dogs to help. Why? Because dogs have an excellent sense of smell. Dogs can smell things that people can't. Dogs help scientists find endangered animals. Then, the scientists can study the animals and help them. We call these dogs "conservation dogs."
Guam is an island with many birds. Many years ago, the first brown tree snakes arrived in Guam. The snakes ate lots of birds. Today, people want to save the birds. Conservation dogs are helping. When boats and planes arrive on Guam, conservation dogs smell them. They can smell snakes inside the boats and cars. Then people catch the snakes.
When there were big fires in Australia, many koalas died. People wanted to help the survivors. But koalas like to hide. They are very hard to see. Conservation dogs helped find the koalas. They saved the koalas!
Conservation dogs have "super" noses. That's good news for endangered animals around the world.

A Dog's Nose Knows
Environment
A dog's sense of smell is thousands of times stronger than a human's, so it's not surprising that dogs are used to find everything - from lost hikers to contraband in airports. People also train dogs to use their noses to protect wildlife. "Conservation dogs" help scientists and conservation workers find, study, and protect endangered animals.
Wild animals can hide really well, and people can't always find them. That's when conservation dogs' powerful sense of smell is useful. These dogs notice small traces animals leave when they pass through nature. For example, conservation dogs find scat that people might miss. Scientists study scat to learn important information about an animal's health and exactly where it lives. This information helps scientists plan the best way to help an endangered species.
Conservation dogs also used their noses to find koalas after recent fires in Australia. Many koalas died, and people tried to save the survivors. Since koalas are so hard to find, the dogs were more successful than humans at finding them.
Another important job for conservation dogs is helping find invasive species. These types of plants and animals move into natural areas and push out the animals that live there. Dogs find invasive species early enough so humans can try to keep them out. In Guam, brown tree snakes are killing a lot of birds that live there. Now, conservation dogs check for the snakes in every boat and plane entering or leaving the island. Because conservation dogs' amazing noses can even find invasive species in water, they protect fish too.
There are thousands of endangered animals in the world today. Which species will these "super noses" help next?

A Dog's Nose Knows
Environment
Dogs' noses have amazing abilities of detection. While humans rely heavily on their eyesight to learn about their surroundings, dogs use their sense of smell - thousands of times stronger than ours! There are many stories about dogs' incredible noses - finding everything from lost hikers to airport contraband. But did you know that humans are training these super noses to protect wildlife and wild places across the globe? "Conservation dogs" help conservation professionals and researchers find, study, and protect endangered animals.
Conservation dogs use their powerful sense of smell to locate animals living in places that are hard for us to see. They also pick up on traces of animals. For example, these highly-trained dogs can track the scent of an animal that has recently passed by, and they nose out scat - the droppings animals leave behind - that people might miss. Studying scat gives scientists critical information about exactly where an animal lives, as well as its overall health. They use this information to figure out the best way to help an endangered species, including designing protocols to protect animals from eager tourists.
Conservation dogs are particularly successful at locating invasive species. When invasive plants or animals move into natural areas, they often compete with native species for limited resources, which can put native wildlife at risk. Dogs find invasive species early enough for wildlife professionals to take action. In Guam, where brown tree snakes have destroyed at least ten native bird species, dogs check boats and planes at points of exit, keeping the dangerous "hitchhikers" from reaching other islands. Conservation dogs can even find invasive species in water. In western USA, a native fish species, the cutthroat trout, is being pushed out by the invasive brook trout. Conservation professionals let the dogs smell buckets of water taken from different rivers. The dogs correctly identify which buckets have brook trout traces.
Conservation dogs' amazing noses also help scientists monitor many endangered species, such as the rare Cross River gorilla in Cameroon. And after the recent bushfires in Australia, conservation dogs worked to locate koalas that survived. Because koalas are very hard to find, the dogs were more successful than human rescuers.
Meanwhile, there are still thousands of endangered animal species. What might these sniffing superstars aim their noses at next?





Did you ever think shoes could be bad for the environment? Of the billions of pairs of shoes made each year, millions are thrown away, ending up in landfills. Because most shoes are made with plastic and rubber instead of sustainable materials, they are almost impossible to recycle. Now, a New Zealand company called YY Nation is making eco-friendly shoes using natural, and unusual, materials.
Jeremy Bank is YY Nation's founder. YY (pronounced waewae) means "foot" in Maori, the indigenous language of New Zealand. Bank knew about footwear from working in his family's chain of shoe stores, Banks Shoes. In 2018, Bank was playing with his daughter on a beach in Maui, Hawaii, USA. He saw tiny bits of plastic mixed in with the sand, and a shoe washed up on the shore. It got him thinking about preserving the environment for his children. "I realized the shoe industry creates a lot of waste," says Bank. So, he began his two-and-a-half-year journey to developing a sustainable shoe.
YY Nation currently offers four different styles of shoes. They include two types of regular sneakers with laces, and one high-top style. The fourth style is a slip-on loafer, which is a shoe with no shoelaces. One of the company's challenges was to create a durable sole without using chemicals. In the end, they made two types of soles. Customers can choose recycled rubber soles mixed with sugar cane, or mixed with locally-sourced algae.
Other natural materials are used, too. There are "leather" parts made from pineapple leaves from the Philippines (which are normally burned as waste), and shoelaces made of recycled ocean plastic. Depending on the style, the top part of the shoes is made from either New Zealand wool, or bamboo woven with nylon thread from recycled plastic. Plant-based glue holds the shoe together. Even the box is environmentally friendly. It's made with recycled materials.
Bank plans to continue finding new and better ways to use materials that already exist. "This is the least sustainable shoe we will ever make," says Bank.

Did you ever think that shoes can be bad for the environment? Millions of pairs of shoes end up in landfills each year. And most are made with plastic and other materials that aren't biodegradable. Now, a New Zealand company called YY Nation is making sustainable shoes using natural, and unusual, materials.
The founder of YY Nation is Jeremy Bank. In 2018, Bank was playing with his daughter on a beach in Hawaii, USA. He saw plastic mixed in with the sand, and an old shoe. This experience made Bank start thinking about how to protect the environment. "I realized the shoe industry creates a lot of waste," says Bank. So, he began his two-and-a-half-year journey to making a sustainable shoe.
YY Nation shoes come in four different styles. They include three types of sneakers with shoelaces. One pair of high-tops and two pairs of low-tops. The fourth style is a loafer, which has no shoelaces.
One of YY Nation's challenges was to create a strong sole for the bottom part of the shoes. But they didn't want to use any chemicals. They decided to use recycled rubber mixed with either sugar cane or algae. The top part of the shoes is made from either New Zealand wool, or bamboo with recycled plastic. Another material YY Nation uses is "leather" made from pineapple leaves. And the shoelaces are made of recycled ocean plastic. Plant-based glue holds the shoe together. Even the shoebox can be recycled!
YY Nation plans to continue finding new ways to use materials that already exist. "This is the least sustainable shoe we will ever make," says Bank.

Shoe companies make billions of pairs of shoes each year. But most companies use materials you can't recycle. So, people throw away millions of old shoes. This is bad for the environment. But now there's a new eco-friendly shoe company. The company is in New Zealand. It's called YY Nation.
YY Nation uses recycled rubber to make the soles. They also use sugar cane or algae. The company makes four different styles of shoes. Three styles are sneakers with shoelaces. The fourth style is a loafer.
To make the top part of the shoe, YY Nation often uses soft wool. The wool is from sheep in New Zealand. Sometimes they mix bamboo and recycled plastic. YY Nation even uses pineapple leaves! The leaves look like leather. They use these "leather" pieces to decorate the top of the shoes. YY Nation also uses special glue. The glue comes from plants. They use recycled ocean plastic to make the shoelaces. Even the shoebox is recycled!
YY Nation plans to make many more shoes with natural materials.




Seaweed for Life!
Environment
What do you know about seaweed? Seaweed is a plant that grows in saltwater. There are more than 11,000 kinds of seaweed. Some look like grass. Others look like lettuce. Seaweed can be red, brown, or green. Seaweed grows in different shapes and sizes. Giant Kelp is a kind of seaweed - it's one of the biggest plants on Earth!
Seaweed has many benefits. Seaweed has a lot of vitamins and minerals. Fertilizer with seaweed keeps your garden healthy. Food companies use seaweed in many products. Seaweed makes yoghurt, ice cream, and other foods creamy. It's also in products you can't eat. For example, seaweed is in shaving cream, and lipstick.
Scientists say seaweed is important. It's good for the planet. It helps keep the air clean. And it's good for the environment, too.
Bren Smith helps people open seaweed farms. Seaweed farms keep sea animals and beaches safe. Seaweed farms also give people jobs. Smith believes growing seaweed is the best way to help the environment. The more seaweed, the better!

Seaweed for Life!
Environment
Did you know that Giant Kelp is one of the largest plants on Earth? But this plant doesn't grow on land. Giant Kelp is one of more than 11,000 types of seaweed. Seaweed is algae, a water plant without roots. Seaweed can be red, brown, or green - and comes in many different sizes. Some types of seaweed look just like grass. Other types look like lettuce!
There are many benefits to having seaweed in our lives. Seaweed has a lot of vitamins and minerals to keep us healthy. Some fertilizers have dried seaweed mixed in with it. The dried seaweed helps keep your garden healthy, too. Seaweed is also used in food. Many companies use seaweed to make their yoghurt, ice cream, and salad dressing thicker. It's in non-food items as well. Toothpaste, shaving cream, and even lipstick can all contain seaweed! Seaweed is a worldwide, billion-dollar industry.
Seaweed is an important part of the Earth's ecosystem. Some sea animals live in seaweed; others eat it. And like all plants, seaweed creates oxygen, and takes in carbon dioxide. This keeps the air clean, and fights global climate change. 
Many people are excited about using seaweed to help prevent climate change. Bren Smith started GreenWave in 2013. GreenWave is an organization that helps people start seaweed farms. Seaweed farms help rebuild damaged ocean ecosystems. How? Seaweed takes in and "cleans up" chemicals which harm the ocean. And seaweed farms create much-needed jobs. Smith believes that seaweed farming will help the environment.
People around the world continue to search for new ways that seaweed can make our lives better. What will they think of next?

Seaweed for Life!
Environment
What comes to mind when you hear the word "seaweed"? Maybe you remember the last time you ate sushi - rice, fish, and vegetables rolled in a sheet of dried seaweed. Perhaps you saw some seaweed washed up on the sand the last time you went to the beach. But what is seaweed? Seaweed is algae - a water plant without roots. Seaweed lives in saltwater, and comes in a range of colors - red, brown, and green. Some seaweed looks like long, flowing grass, and other types have wide, curling leaves. And it ranges in size - from tiny phytoplankton to Giant Kelp - one of the largest plants on Earth! There are more than 11,000 species of this plant!
There are many benefits to having seaweed in our lives. Seaweed is high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. It is used to thicken foods, such as yoghurt, ice cream, and salad dressing. Seaweed is even used in some medications, and in toothpaste, and shaving cream. You'll also find seaweed in lipstick, and other cosmetics.
Seaweed can help your garden grow better too; fertilizer with dried, ground-up seaweed adds important nutrients to soil, such as potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The commercial seaweed market is a worldwide, multi-billion-dollar industry.
Some marine animals live in seaweed; others eat it. Seaweed is also essential to the ecosystem of our planet. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says seaweed makes anywhere from 50% to 80% of the Earth's oxygen. Additionally, seaweed absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Many people are excited about using seaweed to help fight global warming. Seaweed farming projects have begun popping up across the globe. For example, the non-profit organization, GreenWave was founded in 2013 to help people start seaweed farms. In addition to providing job opportunities, the seaweed farms help rebuild marine ecosystems. How? Seaweed absorbs and "cleans up" chemicals which pollute the ocean. GreenWave's founder Bren Smith believes strongly in the power of seaweed farming, "We can either run and hide..., or we can turn around and embrace the sea as a climate change solution," he says.
People around the world continue to search for new ways that seaweed can make our lives better. What will they think of next?





According to the World Health Organization, nine out of ten people worldwide breathe polluted air. Living in cities with dangerously high levels of air pollution can cause health problems, such as heart and lung disease. One way to reduce pollution and make the air safer to breathe is by planting trees. But sometimes, there isn't enough space to plant trees. So, artists are creating giant murals on buildings, using a special kind of paint, called Airlite. Airlite uses energy from sunlight to trap pollutants and change them into harmless substances. The murals actually become air-purifying surfaces!
Italian street artist Federico Massa created a mural at one of the most polluted intersections in Rome. For 21 days, Massa worked on the 1,000-square-meter mural called "Hunting Pollution." It shows a giant heron - an endangered species - hunting in a polluted sea. Massa wants his heron to call attention to environmental issues. The mural, which Massa painted with Airlite, can purify the same amount of air as 30 trees.
As part of their "City Forest" project, the US shoe company Converse is sponsoring a series of eco-friendly murals. The first one was created by artists Teerayut Puechpen and Sorravis Prakong. The pair made an eco-friendly mural in Bangkok, Thailand. The mural's main image is of two hands, which symbolize unity. "I admire that Thai people always help each other when we face critical situations," says Prakong. The mural, painted on the side of a building in the city center, can clean as much air as 150 trees.
The City Forest slogan "Create Together For Tomorrow" appears on a mural near the bustling Politechnika train station in Warsaw, Poland. It has the same environmental effect as planting 780 trees. Graphic designer Dawid Ryski and painter Maciek Polak worked together on the mural, which shows smiling, intertwined flowers surrounded by buildings. Ryski says it shows "... the city and nature complementing each other perfectly."
Converse is planning murals for additional cities, including Lima, Belgrade and Jakarta. Hopefully, artists across the globe will continue to create beautiful artwork to improve air quality for us all.

Art That Cleans the Air

Cities around the world have air pollution. Air pollution is dangerous; it can cause heart and lung disease. One solution is planting trees. Trees help clean the air, making it safer to breathe. In cities, however, there isn't always enough space for trees. So, there's another solution - a special kind of paint, called Airlite. Airlite uses energy from sunlight to clean the air. Artists paint murals with Airlite paint. The murals clean the air, like trees.
Street artist Federico Massa painted a 1,000-square-meter mural in Rome, Italy. Massa completed it in 21 days. In the mural is a water bird called a heron, which is an endangered species. The mural, made with Airlite, can clean the same amount of air as 30 trees.
Recently, the US shoe company Converse started a project called "City Forest." This project helps artists paint eco-friendly murals around the world. Thai artists Teerayut Puechpen and Sorravis Prakong made the project's first mural. They painted the mural on the side of a building, in the center of Bangkok, Thailand. The mural shows two hands, which symbolize unity. It can clean as much air as 150 trees.
Another City Forest mural is in Warsaw, Poland. It is near a busy train station. Graphic designer Dawid Ryski and painter Maciek Polak worked together on the mural. It shows smiling flowers surrounded by skyscrapers. The mural can clean as much air as 780 trees.
Converse is planning more murals for more cities, including Lima, Belgrade and Jakarta. Hopefully, artists will continue to create beautiful artwork to clean our air.

Is It Messy or Is It Cluttercore?
Lifestyle
Some houses have clutter. "Clutter" is when there are too many things in one space. Many people think clutter is bad. They say clutter makes a house look messy. But lots of people like to collect things. They put their collections all over the house. They don't think this is "clutter." They think it's "cluttercore."
Cluttercore is a new way to decorate your house. With cluttercore, you decorate your house with objects you collect. But you organize them, so they don't look messy. For example, you may have a collection of dolls, and a collection of clocks. You put your dolls on a table in the living room. You put your clocks on a wall in the dining room.
Daniel Mathis loves cluttercore. Cluttercore fills Mathis's apartment. His collection of old wooden rulers is on the bedroom floor. His collection of black candles is on a table. Mathis also collects seashells and pottery. Mathis shares pictures of his collections on the Internet. Many people call Mathis the "King of Cluttercore!"

Is It Messy or Is It Cluttercore?
Lifestyle
Many children collect things, like rocks, stickers, or small dolls. But when they become adults, they're expected to "tidy up" and throw their collections away. This is because most home designers focus on neat, clean homes, and encourage people to "declutter." Yet many adults enjoy collecting. They want to keep their old collections or collect new things. Well, they're in luck! There is a new design trend called "cluttercore."
With cluttercore, people collect things, but display them in a neat and organized way. If they collect different types of objects, they group similar items together, and display each group in a different place. For example, they may take their collection of pictures and cover an entire wall with them. Then they may take their collection of clocks and display them on a table.
Daniel Mathis is a huge fan of cluttercore. Mathis lives in a large 111.5 square-meter apartment in Oklahoma, USA. He has tables covered with knickknacks; one holds a group of black candles. His collection of  antique wooden rulers sits on the bedroom floor. Paintings hang on a green wall in the dining room. And his seashell collection sits among many other collections in his home office. He also has more than 400 pieces of pottery, which are displayed around the house.
Mathis and other cluttercore fans share their collections on the Internet. Cluttercore became extremely popular on social media during the pandemic. People were stuck at home, feeling worried. Surrounding themselves with "stuff" made them feel better. Cluttercore lets people celebrate their clutter. "Why fight it?" says Mathis. "It's what I love to do."

Is It Messy or Is It Cluttercore?
Lifestyle
Children often collect things, such as rocks, dolls, or stickers. Research shows that being surrounded by their objects makes children happy and secure. But when children become adults, they're expected to be more organized, and make sure their homes don't have too much clutter. "Clutter is stuff that is no longer useful but gets in the way of living," says Jennifer Howard, who wrote a book called Clutter: An Untidy History. Most modern design trends encourage people to tidy up rooms, and "declutter" their homes. Yet, many adults enjoy collecting. They might want to keep their old collections, or create new ones. Lucky for them, there's a new design trend called "cluttercore."
With cluttercore, people keep and celebrate their collections, instead of throwing them away. In crowded cluttercore rooms, many things are on display, but they're organized. The idea is to group similar items together, and give each group its own area, so rooms don't feel messy. For example, you may display a collection of photographs by covering a wall with them, from top to bottom. In the same room, take a different group of objects, such as clocks or small statues, and display them on a table.
Collector Daniel Mathis is sometimes called the "King of Cluttercore.'' His different collections are arranged around his large 111.5 square meter apartment in Oklahoma, USA. Two tables are completely covered with objects made of brass. Another has a bunch of tall black candles. Paintings of faces hang on a green wall in the dining room. Mathis keeps a framed seashell collection in his home office, as well as part of his pottery collection - he has more than 400 pieces of pottery around the house! "Collecting is in my blood... and so why fight it?" says Mathis. "It's what I love to do."
Like other cluttercore fans, Mathis shares his cluttercore pictures on the Internet. Cluttercore began trending on social media during the pandemic. For many people stuck at home, cluttercore was just what the doctor ordered. "We want[ed] to feel safe, we want[ed] to feel comfortable, we want[ed] to feel protected and taken care of - stuff can act like a literal cocoon," says Howard. Can cluttercore change our views on clutter?





For many of us, living on a budget can be challenging. However, the Internet has tons of tips on how we can manage our money. In fact, one budgeting method is blowing up on social media. It's a surprisingly low-tech method, called "cash stuffing." Cash stuffing is just a new name for an old system called "envelope budgeting." It involves using envelopes to help you save money.
To start, you'll need envelopes - one for each type of expense you have, such as food, clothing, utilities, and travel. Write the name of each category on a different envelope. Next, figure out how much you spend each month in each category. Then, when you get paid, leave enough money in the bank for fixed expenses - such as car payments or rent - and take the rest in cash. Finally, divide up the cash between the different envelopes. "Stuff" the correct amount of money you need into each one. If you have any cash left over, put it in an envelope labeled "savings" to keep for a rainy day. Or have a special envelope for something you want to save up for or treat yourself to.
Cash stuffing helps you save money by making you aware of your spending, and not letting you spend money you don't have. If you put $100 dollars in your "clothes" envelope, then when you go shopping, you're limited to spending that amount. If you want to spend more, you can take money from another envelope, if it's available. If not, $100 it is! So, you'll never go over budget like you can with credit cards, which allow you to spend money you don't have, and can cause you to get into debt.
Although cash stuffing is low-tech and old-school, it has become extremely popular among millennials.
It's so popular, that millions of viewers watch videos on social media of people just stuffing envelopes with cash. Of course, they cash stuff in style, with long, manicured nails and using colorful plastic envelopes. In fact, many companies are now selling cool cash stuffing supplies. But don't buy any, unless you have money set aside for it in a "cash stuffing" envelope!
 

Don't Spend it. Stuff it!
Lifestyle
Have you seen the popular "cash stuffing" videos on social media? People open envelopes and fill them with cash. Cash stuffing is a way of budgeting your money, so you don't spend more money than you have.
To start, you need envelopes - one for each type of expense you have, such as food, clothing, utilities, and travel. Write the name of each category on a different envelope. Next, figure out how much you spend each month in each category. Then, when you get paid, take the money in cash. Finally, divide up the cash between the different envelopes. "Stuff" the correct amount of money you need into each one. If you have any cash left over, put it in an envelope labeled "savings." Or create an envelope for something special that you want, like new shoes.
Then, when you go shopping - for shoes, for example - bring your "shoes" envelope. If the envelope has $40 in it, you have $40 to spend. You can't spend more. This is better than using a credit card. Credit cards let you to spend money you don't have, which can get you into debt.
Cash stuffing isn't actually new. It's an old budgeting method that used to be called "envelope budgeting." But even though cash stuffing is old-school, and also low-tech, it is very popular with millennials. Many people make videos of themselves stuffing cash in their envelopes. And millions of viewers watch them! Some "cash stuffers" use fancy, decorated envelopes. And many companies are selling these cool cash stuffing supplies. But don't buy them - unless you have an envelope labelled "cash stuffing supplies!"

Don't Spend it. Stuff it!
Lifestyle
It's hard to save money. But "cash stuffing" can help. Cash stuffing is a way to budget your money.
To start, think of expenses you have each month, like food and the phone bill. Then, get envelopes. Write each expense on a different envelope. Next, think of something you want to buy, such as clothes. Make an envelope for that too. Also, make a "savings" envelope.
When you get a paycheck, take the money in cash. Then "pay" your envelopes. For example, is your phone bill $35? Then put $35 in your "phone bill" envelope. Do you have any cash left after you stuffed your envelopes? Put that extra money into the "savings" envelope.
The next time you go clothes shopping, take the "clothes" envelope with you. Use only the cash in the envelope. Don't use credit cards. Credit cards let you spend more money than you have.
Many young people make videos of themselves doing cash stuffing. Millions of people watch them. But don't watch cash stuffing. Do it!





Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep each night to stay healthy. But many people don't sleep well. What can they do? Take a sleep vacation! When you take a sleep vacation, you travel to special hotels. These hotels help you sleep better.

One example is the Zedwell in London, England. It has very comfortable beds. And their rooms are soundproof, so no noise gets it. The Zedwell's rooms don't have televisions. They also don't have windows. So, there is nothing else to do!
Another sleep vacation hotel is the H�stens Sleep Spa Hotel in Coimbra, Portugal. Guests choose pillows from a menu. They may choose a soft pillow or a hard pillow.
The Mandarin Oriental hotel is in Geneva, Switzerland. This hotel helps you learn how to sleep better. Guests at the Mandarin Oriental work with Swiss sleep experts for three days. The experts make a sleep plan for each guest. The plan helps guests learn what to do to fall asleep and stay asleep.
Sleep vacations can be a dream come true!

Take a Sleep Vacation!
Lifestyle
Sleep is very important. Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep a night to stay healthy. But many people have difficulty falling - and staying - asleep. This has led to a trend called "sleep tourism." Sleep tourism means traveling somewhere to get a good night's sleep!
Sleep tourists stay in hotels that help encourage good sleep. An example is the Zedwell hotel in London. All rooms are soundproof, so it's completely quiet. And, according to the Zedwell, they have "the most comfortable mattresses in the world." To keep guests from getting distracted, the rooms have no televisions, and they don't even have windows.
Another hotel for sleep tourists is the H�stens Sleep Spa Hotel in Coimbra, Portugal. Sleep spa guests get a "pillow menu," which allows them to choose their pillow based on how hard or soft they want it to be.
The Park Hyatt New York is a sleep tourist hotel in the US. It has an 84-square-meter "sleep suite," which has amenities to help guests sleep. For example, they have very soft sheets, a special sleep mask, and scented oil.
For guests who want to improve their sleep long-term, there's the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. Over three days, guests work with sleep experts. The experts check the guests' sleep quality. Each guest gets a personalized sleep plan to help them develop healthy sleep habits.
Dr. Rebecca Robbins is a sleep researcher. She believes in learning good sleep habits. "Sleep is food for our brain and our body," she says.

Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep each night for their physical and mental health. But for people with sleep disorders, this is only a dream! Sleep disorders affect people around the world, including 70 million people in the US alone. This has led to a trend called "sleep tourism" - traveling to get a good night's sleep!
Most people go on vacation to have fun and escape everyday life. But sleep tourists travel to special hotels to sleep. While all hotels are meant for sleeping, sleep-tourism hotels cater to people with sleep disorders. These hotels follow the rules of good sleep hygiene, which includes a bedroom that is comfortable, quiet and relaxing, and has no television, digital devices, or other distractions.
One sleep-tourism hotel is the Zedwell, in London, England. It promises "the most comfortable mattresses in the world." The Zedwell is the city's first hotel where all the rooms are designed to encourage sleep. Just like a regular hotel, the rooms have a bed and bathroom. But there isn't a television to distract guests or keep them awake. To keep things quiet, the rooms are also windowless and soundproof. In fact, the Zedwell calls their rooms "cocoons."
Another sleep tourism hotel is the H�stens Sleep Spa Hotel in Coimbra, Portugal. One of their amenities is a pillow menu. Guests select pillows made of natural materials based on how hard or soft they are.
In the US, sleep tourists can visit the Park Hyatt New York. The hotel has a special 84-square-meter "sleep suite" and provides many amenities for peaceful sleep, including soft bed linens, a special sleep mask, and scented oil.
Sleep researcher Dr. Rebecca Robbins thinks sleep-tourism hotels should also help guests long-term. The Mandarin Oriental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, does just that. Guests of the hotel can consult with CENAS, a Swiss sleep medicine center. During a three-day stay, guests have their sleep quality evaluated. Then, they are given a plan for improving their sleep, which might include a change in diet or starting meditation.
Whether you're on a "sleep vacation'' or at home, Dr. Robbins says it's important to relax close to bedtime. "Sleep is food for our brain and our body," she says.





Around ten years ago, Rob Greenfield, an environmental activist popular on social media, decided to stop wearing shoes - even on the streets of New York! And he's not the only one. Over the past decade, walking or running without shoes has become popular as more people embrace a "barefoot lifestyle."
Going barefoot may seem like a new trend, but humans only started wearing shoes about 40,000 years ago. Before then, they moved barefoot over all types of terrain. Walking barefoot builds up tough, thick layers of skin on the sole of the foot. These tough areas of skin, called calluses, protect the feet from extreme temperatures, rocks, and other sharp objects. When humans first started wearing shoes, they wore just thin-soled sandals.
"Barefooters" reject wearing shoes for different reasons. Australian podiatrist Paul Thompson started going barefoot to relieve aches and pains. The soles of our feet have nerve endings that give the brain information about where and how we're moving. Thompson believes shoes cut off this information, make the body move unnaturally, and cause pain or injury. Thompson also says that going barefoot uses certain muscles that strengthen the body.
 
Each summer, Christiane Viehweger searches for edible plants in the forest near her home in Germany - barefoot. Viehweger believes that wearing shoes makes it harder to connect with nature. There are even hiking paths designed just for bare feet. At Godolphin House in Cornwall, England, visitors can let their feet explore smooth wood surfaces, grass and sand, on a "barefoot trail."
Still, not everyone agrees that a barefoot life is the healthiest one. Some podiatrists warn that walking barefoot (especially outside) exposes us to harmful bacteria, fungus, and possible illness. Others say that walking barefoot for an extended amount of time can put too much strain on our feet.
It does, however, seem that humans could benefit from going barefoot some of the time. A good compromise may be wearing minimalist shoes like our ancestors did, which protect the foot while allowing it to move naturally. For those who want to attempt the barefoot lifestyle, Greenfield suggests starting slowly, gradually increasing the amount of time you spend barefoot. Eventually, he believes, you'll be living a more relaxed, stress-free, barefoot life.

Rob Greenfield hasn't worn shoes in almost ten years! Greenfield, an environmental activist who is popular on social media, goes barefoot wherever he can - even on city streets! He says it helps him stay relaxed. Greenfield is one of many people choosing a "barefoot life."
Until about 40,000 years ago, all humans went barefoot. As they walked, they developed calluses on the bottoms of their feet. These calluses protected the soles of their feet as they walked over rough surfaces, rocks, and sharp objects. When humans started wearing shoes, they wore thin-soled sandals.
People have different reasons for going barefoot. Australian Paul Thompson is a podiatrist. He started going barefoot to reduce pain. Thompson says that shoes prevent us from using some important muscles, while going barefoot makes these muscles stronger. Thompson also believes shoes make our feet less sensitive. The soles of our feet have nerve endings, which give the brain information about the best way to move; shoes just get in the way.
Each summer, Christiane Viehweger walks barefoot in the forest near her home in Germany. She says it helps her connect with nature. There are even "barefoot hiking paths," like one in Cornwall, England, where visitors walk barefoot over surfaces such as grass, sand, and wood.
But not everyone recommends the barefoot life. Some podiatrists say that a lot of barefoot walking puts too much stress on your feet. Greenfield says it's best to go barefoot a little at a time. Then see if you enjoy the barefoot life!

Paul Thompson is a foot doctor. Thompson goes barefoot, too. He started because his feet hurt. When he went barefoot, his feet stopped hurting! Thompson thinks shoes make us walk in an unnatural way. This is bad for our feet. He says shoes makes some muscles weak. Walking barefoot makes these muscles stronger.
But other foot doctors disagree. They say walking barefoot isn't safe; you can hurt yourself. Your feet can get an infection. They say walking barefoot can put too much pressure on your feet. Other doctors think it's good to go barefoot sometimes.
Kick off your shoes and see what you think of the barefoot life!





Do you have clothes that make you feel good? Dawnn Karen is a fashion psychologist. Karen studies how our clothing makes us feel. She says that wearing certain clothes puts us in a good mood. This is dopamine dressing.
Dopamine is a chemical in the brain. Dopamine tells the body how to feel. When you have a lot of dopamine, you feel happy. 
Karen says that yellow makes many people feel happy So, they wear yellow clothes to get into a good mood. Other people feel happy when they wear bright colors. But it's not only about color. Some people feel happy when they wear soft material, or when they wear patterns, like stripes.
Sometimes, even a kind of clothing can make you feel a certain way. Some people feel confident when they wear a suit. Memories are important too. A T-shirt may make you think of a happy memory. Then, when you wear the T-shirt, you feel happy.
Do you want to try dopamine dressing? Then go find something "happy" to wear!

In The Mood For Fashion
Lifestyle
Do you ever wake up feeling low on energy? Dawnn Karen, a fashion psychologist, suggests putting on a favorite piece of clothing. It can make you feel happier and give you more energy. It's also good for your mental health. Karen calls this dopamine dressing - wearing clothes that improve your mood.
Dopamine is a complicated chemical in our brains. It affects our feelings and behaviors. With dopamine dressing, you wear clothes that increase this "happy" chemical. Wearing certain colors, for example, can improve your mood. Karen says that most people associate yellow with joy and hope.
But it's not all about color. Certain patterns can make you feel good and connect with happy memories. Sometimes, the feeling of a certain fabric on your skin can put you in a good mood. For some people, wearing a certain type or style of clothing - like a suit - can make them feel stronger and more powerful. It is all very individual. Different pieces of clothing affect people in different ways.
Karen discusses this connection between clothing and mood in her book Dress Your Best Life. And there is research to back her up. A 2012 study at Northwestern University in Illinois, USA, showed that wearing certain clothes can change the way we feel and act. And a 2015 study at the University of Rochester in NY, USA, showed that color influences feelings. 
Do you want to try dopamine dressing? Karen has some advice. She suggests starting your day quietly thinking about how you want to feel. Then, go search your closet for the outfit to bring on that mood!

In The Mood For Fashion
Lifestyle
Do you know the saying, "When you look good, you feel good?" Fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen believes it 100 percent! Karen says that you can use what you wear to actively influence your mood. She calls this dopamine dressing. According to Karen, dopamine dressing makes you feel more confident, competent, and happy, and has a positive effect on your mental health.
And she's not alone. A 2012 study at Northwestern University in Illinois, USA, shows that wearing certain clothes can change the way we feel and act. It all depends on a person's personal associations. So, if you associate a certain T-shirt with a happy time or event in your life, then you will feel happy when you wear it. Similarly, a 2015 study at the University of Rochester in NY, USA, showed that certain colors can influence people's moods. Specific colors, explains Karen, correspond to specific emotions. One example she uses is yellow. Karen says it's a color many people connect to joy and hope.
Where did the term dopamine dressing come from? Karen has been credited with coining the phrase. Dopamine is a chemical in our brains - sometimes called the "happy hormone" - that affects our emotions, motivation, and behavior. Dopamine motivates a person to keep doing what makes them feel happy. So, dopamine dressing is choosing an outfit to intentionally raise the dopamine level in your brain, and boost your mood.
The phrase dopamine dressing is all over social media, often when displaying images of brightly-colored clothing. But dopamine dressing isn't just about color. The pattern on a piece of clothing can also connect someone to a happy memory. So can the feeling of a certain fabric against a person's skin. Some people find that wearing a certain style or article of clothing - like a suit - helps them feel more confident and powerful. Dopamine dressing is very individual.
Karen discusses the way clothes and mood are intertwined in a book she wrote called Dress Your Best Life. Karen's advice is to spend the first few minutes of your day, while you're still in bed, quietly thinking about the mood you want to have. Then, go search your closet for an outfit that fits!





During the pandemic, when many people were stuck indoors, their homes took on new functions - becoming schools and offices too. Nancy K. Keenan, an architect, realized that home design needed to change accordingly. So, in 2020, her team - along with researchers - conducted the America at Home Study. In the study, people were asked what changes they would like to see in their homes as a result of the pandemic. Then Keenan and her team designed a real-life "concept home," called Barnaby, which incorporates many of these changes.
Barnaby is a two-story home in North Carolina, USA. It's intended for a family with children, in which one parent works from home and the other works outside the home. The kitchen is in the center of the house, and is a place to cook, eat, work, and study. The kitchen table is designed as a homework station, and an area for kids to help prepare meals. There are low shelves that children can reach, encouraging them to be independent.
Barnaby has a quiet space for video calls, called the "Zoom room," and a "secret room," whose door is hidden behind a bookcase in a bedroom, for privacy. Another room can be used as a classroom, and afterwards a playroom; it has built-in desks, as well as storage for toys and games. There are also smaller, flexible spaces around the house that can be adapted for various activities, such as meditating, exercising, or watching movies.
The study showed that health at home is top priority. So, Barnaby's main entryway has a bathroom where people can wash their hands before entering. There's also a guest apartment - with its own kitchen - separate from the rest of the house, in case someone needs to quarantine. Barnaby has a front porch and a large, covered space in the back, so you can get fresh air - even if you can't leave the house.
Barnaby is currently open to visitors, and Keenan hopes it'll inspire others to create similar homes. But Barnaby will eventually be sold and used as a regular home. "It's a home built for how people want to live in today's world," says Keenan, "and we can't wait for people to experience it."

Welcome Home!
Lifestyle
During the pandemic, many people stayed at home for weeks. Homes became schools, offices, and places to "hang out." This made architect Nancy K. Keenan think of something: designers should build homes that fit these changes. So, in 2020, she worked with researchers on the America at Home Study. In the study, researchers asked people what changes they would want in their homes after experiencing the pandemic. Then, Keenan created a real home based on their answers. The house, called Barnaby, is in North Carolina, USA.
Barnaby is a house for a family. In the middle, is a child-friendly kitchen. It's a place to cook, eat, work, and study. Children can do homework or help prepare food at the table. There are low shelves that younger children can reach, so they can do things on their own.
Barnaby has a quiet "Zoom room" for video calls. There's a room that can first be used as a classroom, and then a playroom; it has desks, and places for toys and games. There are also open spaces around the house. They can be used for exercising, watching movies, or other activities.
To help keep the family healthy, Barnaby's main entryway has a bathroom. You can wash your hands before you go into the main house. There's also a separate apartment for guests, with its own kitchen. Someone who needs to quarantine can stay there. Barnaby has a large, covered space in the backyard, so you can "go outside" - even if you can't leave the house.
People can visit Barnaby. Keenan hopes it will inspire other home designers. One day, Barnaby will be used as a real home.

During the pandemic, people stayed home for many weeks. Adults worked at home. Children learned at home. Homes were crowded!
Nancy K. Keenan is an architect. She says homes need to be different now, because of the pandemic. For example, families need more space. So, Keenan designed a house called Barnaby. 
Barnaby has a very large kitchen. It's easy for adults and children to cook together. You can eat at the kitchen table. But it's also a place to work. Adults work. Children do homework. Barnaby also has smaller rooms. The small "Zoom room" is very quiet. It's a special room for video calls.
Some rooms are flexible. The family can use them in different ways. One room is a classroom. Then, it is a playroom. There are desks for class. There are shelves with toys and games.
Barnaby has a bathroom near the front door. First, people wash their hands. Then, they go inside the house.
You can visit Barnaby. It is in North Carolina, USA. Keenan hopes more people will make houses like Barnaby.




Digital Fashion
Lifestyle
Usually, people make clothing with material. They sew pieces of material together. But now, there is digital clothing. People use computers to design digital clothing. You "wear" digital clothing only online. For example, you can post a picture of yourself on social media. In the picture it looks like you're wearing the clothes. But you're not really wearing them.
You buy digital fashion online. First, you go to a digital fashion company's Web site. They have shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes, and accessories. Next, you order something you like. Then, you send a photo of yourself to the Web site. After a few days, you get the photo back. It's a picture of you wearing the digital clothing! Now, you can put the picture on social media.
Making real clothes is bad for the environment. Digital clothing solves this problem. Digital clothes also cost less than real clothing. Maybe someday, we'll all have digital closets to hold our digital clothes!

Lifestyle
Recently, writer Christian Allaire got a new outfit. It has green pants and a long black coat. Allaire posted a photo of his new clothes on social media. What's special about his outfit? It doesn't really exist! Allaire was wearing digital clothes. Digital clothes aren't made of cloth or material. They're made using computer technology!
Just like with traditional fashion, you can buy shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes, and accessories - only digital versions. The difference is that with digital clothes, you can't touch what you buy. You can only "wear" the clothes online. You can post a picture of yourself wearing the clothes on social media, for example.
One benefit to digital clothing is that it's more sustainable than traditional clothing. Making clothes causes lots of pollution. And many people actually buy clothes to wear just once, to post on social media. With digital clothes people can get new outfits as often as they want, without harming the environment.
Another benefit is that designer clothing costs less when it's digital. For example, sneakers from the designer brand Gucci, usually cost hundreds of dollars. But a pair of digital Gucci sneakers sells for less than 20 dollars.
Digital clothing also "fits" each customer perfectly. To get your digital clothes, you upload a photo of yourself to a digital fashion company's app. They send you a photo with your digital outfit blended onto your body. Now, your picture is ready for posting!
Today, more and more people on the Internet are wearing digital clothing. Maybe one day, everyone will have some clothing that exists only online. What will you hang in your digital closet?

Writer Christian Allaire was thrilled with a new outfit he bought - silver and green pants and a long black coat with light green ribbons. He thought it made him look like a superhero. But like superheroes, Allaire's outfit doesn't really exist. Allaire was wearing digital clothing!
More and more people on the Internet are wearing digital (or 3-D) clothing. Digital clothing isn't made of real, tangible materials; designers create them using new computer technologies. As with traditional fashion items, you can buy digital shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes, and accessories. However, after you buy them, you can only "wear" your clothes online - by posting pictures of yourself on social media, for example.
Why choose clothing made of pixels rather than textiles? One reason is the environment. According to a recent UK study, almost one in ten British people have admitted to having bought clothes to wear as a "one-off" outfit to post on social media. But producing clothing creates a lot of pollution. With digital clothing, this isn't a problem. People can get new and exciting outfits as often as they want. And for people who buy designer fashion items, digital clothing is a bargain. A real pair of Gucci sneakers costs hundreds of dollars, while a digital pair costs less than 20 dollars!
Another benefit of digital clothing is that it's customized to each person, so it "fits" perfectly. Customers upload a photo of themselves to the digital fashion company's app or Web site. Then, they receive a photo with their outfit professionally edited onto their bodies - and ready for posting.
Digital clothing allows designers to be extremely creative. They can create outfits with features that can't exist in the real world. Imagine clothes that are made of water, change colors, or have animated words or patterns! "The possibilities are endless and fun," says Stephy Fung, a digital fashion designer.
Like regular clothing, digital clothing can take time to make. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for customers to receive their digitally augmented photo. But in the future, the process could happen instantly. Perhaps someday, everyone will have some items of clothing that exist only online. Get ready to start shopping for your digital closet!





On a steep hill next to Germany's Lahn River sits the charming city of Marburg. Tourists enjoy the historic architecture of this fairy-tale town. And students come from around the world to go to its university. But most interesting about Marburg is the fact that it's a Blindenstadt ("blind city") � a city adapted to people who are blind or visually impaired.
Marburg is home to Blindenstudienanstalt, commonly called "Blista." Blista is a school for children and young people who are blind or visually impaired. After graduating from Blista, many students stay in Marburg to live, perhaps working or going to university. As a result, the blind population of Marburg is constantly growing, and the city has become a hub for them. Some blind residents call Marburg their "Capital City." 
Marburg is helpful to blind people in all different ways. Traffic lights make beeping sounds to let them know when it's safe to cross the street. At "talking" bus stops, they can hear information about bus arrivals. Bus drivers are trained to help too, by stopping right in front of a waiting blind passenger, for example, and letting them know which seats are empty.
For blind people who use a cane to walk around the city, Marburg's streets and sidewalks have small bumps and ridges. As the person walks, they tap the sidewalk with their cane. The bumps and ridges let them know they're approaching an obstacle or dangerous area.
More than 30 local restaurants in the Blindenstadt offer menus in Braille, and buildings such as the Ahrens department store have raised maps and floor plans. There are special tours of Marburg for blind people, where they can feel their way around miniature models of major city attractions.
One of these attractions is the six-kilometer Marburg Planetary Trail, where visitors encounter tactile models of the planets, along with explanations in Braille. The city also has many sports activities adapted for blind people, such as horseback riding, soccer, and skiing.
And Marburg continues to make the city more accessible, creating an even better and stronger Blindenstadt. Living in such a supportive community is inspiring. As one former Blista student says, "It gives you courage; it makes you dare to try out new things."

Marburg is helpful to its blind residents in many ways. The city's traffic lights make noises to let them know when it's safe to cross the street. "Talking" bus stops, give information about bus schedules. And when a blind person gets on a bus, the driver directs him or her to the closest free seat.

Want to Create? Take a Walk!
Lifestyle
Walking helps us relax. Walking also helps us think in creative ways.
 Authors need to be creative all the time. But thinking of new ideas is hard. Famous authors L.M. Montgomery and Ernest Hemingway took long walks. They said it helped them think of new ideas. 
Steve Jobs also took walks to think better. Jobs had "walking meetings" at his company, Apple, Inc. Jobs and his employees walked and talked. Other companies have walking meetings too. They say employees think of better ideas when they walk.
Scientists also say that walking makes people creative. Some scientists say the right side of the brain is the "thinking" side. The left side of the brain is the "creative" side. Usually, one side of the brain works harder than the other. But when you walk, both sides of your brain work together. This is good for your imagination.
So, the next time you want to be creative, take a nice, long walk!

Want to Create? Take a Walk!
Lifestyle
You probably know that going for a long walk helps you feel calm and relaxed. But did you know that it can make you more creative as well?
Many great thinkers of the past have benefited from the act of walking. Philosopher Aristotle used to walk around while teaching his students. Scientist Nikola Tesla took long daily walks to help him focus his ideas. And when authors such as L.M. Montgomery and Ernest Hemingway had writer's block, they would go on walks too.
Modern businesses are also benefiting from walking. Apple, Inc. founder Steve Jobs was known for holding walking meetings. He believed they helped people come up with more creative solutions to problems. Today, many employers find walking meetings more productive than "sit-down" meetings. Walking gives your brain a break from its regular patterns of thinking. This leads to new, creative ideas.
Science supports the walking-creativity connection. For example, in a study at the University of Graz, in Austria, researchers found that people who walked for exercise were more innovative than those who didn't. And a Stanford University study showed that creative thinking is enhanced while walking and for a short time afterward. One reason given is that the right side of the brain is the "logical" side, and the left side of the brain is the "creative" side. When you walk, both sides of your brain work together and communicate with each other.
So, head outside for a walk and get your creative juices flowing!

Want to Create? Take a Walk!
Lifestyle
You're taking a walk one morning. You get into a rhythm, and begin to "zone out." Soon, you're hardly aware that you're walking at all. You're feeling calm, relaxed, and creative. Solutions to problems are forming in your head. Sounds familiar? You're in good company!
Throughout the centuries, many great philosophers, scientists, and writers have benefited from the act of walking. Philosopher Aristotle used to pace back and forth while teaching his students. Scientist Nikola Tesla took long daily walks to help him focus his ideas before sitting down and writing. Authors L.M. Montgomery and Ernest Hemingway said that walking cured their writer's block.
Today, businesses are also getting into the act. Instead of holding meetings indoors, many entrepreneurs are taking meetings outside the office, while walking. They believe these "walking meetings" are more productive than traditional sit-down meetings. This idea was popularized by Apple, Inc. founder Steve Jobs. Jobs would insist on walking meetings, especially when he needed to think differently to solve a problem. Walking gives your brain a break, and gets you out of your usual thought patterns, leading to new, creative ideas.
Science supports this idea - that the imagination is enhanced by physical activity, especially walking. According to one theory, walking creates "whole-brain" thinking. The left side of the brain, which is associated with logical thinking, controls movement of the right side of the body. The right side of the brain, associated with creativity, controls the left side of the body. When you walk, both sides of your brain communicate with each other, moving you from one foot to the other and causing logical and creative thoughts to flow.
In a study at the University of Graz, in Austria, researchers found that active people who walked for exercise came up with more innovative ways to complete a drawing than sedentary people. A Stanford University study showed that creative thinking improves not only while walking, but shortly thereafter too.
We know that exercise helps keep our brains healthy. Now, we're starting to understand that putting one foot in front of the other can help our brains be more creative, as well. So, leave your computer inside, and head out for an energizing brain break!





Norway's long, dark winters and short days of sunlight come with average temperatures below -6 degrees C. You might think Norwegians pass the winter sipping hot cocoa in front of warm fires, but actually they love to go outdoors and enjoy their natural, frozen landscape. Whether the cold weather is wet or snowy, being outdoors is so much a part of the lifestyle, that there are "Right to Roam" laws, which allow Norwegians to walk almost anywhere they want - as long as they respect their surroundings. Norwegians even have a special name for being outdoors in nature: friluftsliv (pronounced free-loofts-leev), meaning "open-air living."
The term, which was first used by writer Henrik Ibsen in a poem about hiking and living in the Norwegian wilderness, involves embracing the cold outdoors instead of avoiding it. Surprisingly, it's good for you! Having a positive attitude toward wintertime helps people stay healthy. "You get kind of a time-out from cellphones and computers... being outdoors and in nature. It's one of the best places to relax," says Lasse Heimdal, the head of Norsk Friluftsliv, an organization for friluftsliv groups in Norway. In addition to improving physical health, research shows that being outside can increase your feeling of well-being, so it makes perfect sense that Norwegians are a very happy people. In fact, the UN's World Happiness Report lists Norway as one of the ten happiest countries in the world.
Is friluftsliv for everyone? Of course! Even children can participate. You don't need special equipment - just warm, comfortable clothing. You don't have to be an athlete either, since there's no skiing or ice skating required. Taking long walks with friends, having a picnic, or going for a leisurely bike ride are all friluftsliv activities that anyone can do. For some people, drinking a cup of tea bundled up in a parka is enough, and Heimdal says that's just fine.
The COVID-19 crisis has caused indoor activities to be restricted around the world, but the outdoors is one of the safest places for socializing. That's another reason to try friluftsliv. So, grab your warmest coat, and get ready to try friluftsliv. As the Norwegian saying goes, "There's no bad weather, only bad clothing!"

Winter Is the Perfect Time for Friluftsliv
Lifestyle
In Norway, winters are long, and it often gets as cold as -6 degrees C. Do you think Norwegians sit at home drinking hot chocolate and trying to stay warm? Actually, Norwegians love to go outdoors and enjoy nature - even in cold, wet, or snowy weather! Norwegians have a special name for being outdoors in nature: friluftsliv (pronounced free-loofts-leev). Friluftsliv means "open-air living."
With friluftsliv, you embrace the cold outdoors. You don't hide from it. This type of positive thinking can help you stay healthy. "You get kind of a time-out from cellphones and computers... being outdoors and in nature. It's one of the best places to relax," says Lasee Heimal. Heimal runs Norsk Friluftsliv, a friluftsliv group in Norway. Being outdoors is also good for your mood, not just your physical health. Maybe that's one reason that Norway is one of the ten happiest countries in the world, according to the UN's World Happiness Report.
Is friluftsliv for everyone? Of course! Children can do it, too. You don't have to do winter sports like skiing or ice skating, and you don't need any special equipment. Just make sure to wear warm, comfortable clothing. Take a long walk with friends, have a picnic, or go for a bike ride. These are all friluftsliv activities.
During the COVID-19 crisis, people are spending a lot of time indoors. But the outdoors is one of the safest places for socializing. That's another reason to try friluftsliv.

It is important for people to spend time outdoors. It's healthy for their bodies and their minds. That's why friluftsliv is good for people. Friluftsliv also makes people feel happy. Are you feeling sad or bored? Try friluftsliv. You will feel better!
Are you thinking, "I'm not good at sports"? Don't worry. Anyone can do friluftsliv. Children can do it, too. You don't need skis. You don't need ice skates. Just go outdoors! Is it -6 degrees C outside? That's okay. Go outdoors anyway! Just remember one thing: wear warm clothing. In Norway, people say, "There's no bad weather, only bad clothing!"




The Auntie Sewing Squad

People around the world are wearing masks because of COVID-19. But in some places, it's hard to find masks. Now, a group of volunteers is helping people get masks. How? They are sewing them! Meet the Auntie Sewing Squad!
Kristina Wong started the Auntie Sewing Squad. Wong is an actress in Los Angeles, California. But she isn't working now, because of COVID. So, Wong has a lot of free time. She also has a lot of fabric. Wong uses the fabric to make masks.
Wong sewed a mask. She wore the mask on social media. Wong asked if people wanted one. Hundreds of people said yes! Wong needed help. She looked for volunteers on social media to help her sew them.
At first, 26 people joined the squad. Today, there are more than 800 sewers (or "aunties"). There are sewers in Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and other states. They made more than 50,000 masks!  And now, the squad also gives out diapers and cleaning supplies! They want to help in any way that they can.

Today, millions of people around the world are wearing masks during the COVID-19 crisis. But in some areas of the US, masks can be hard to find. Now, a group of volunteers is trying to help. Volunteers all over the US are sewing and delivering masks to people who need them. Meet the Auntie Sewing Squad!
 
Actress Kristina Wong started the Auntie Sewing Squad in Los Angeles, California. Wong had a lot of fabric at home because she used it to make props for her shows. Due to the crisis, all her shows were cancelled. So, she decided to use her free time (and fabric) to make masks. Wong posted a photo of one of her colorful masks on social media. She offered to mail people free masks. Hundreds of people replied! Wong quickly realized that she couldn't fill all the orders herself. She sent a message on social media asking for sewing help. And the Auntie Sewing Squad was born!
Starting with just 26 volunteers, Wong's group now has more than 800 sewers across the US. Today, the group helps communities where people don't have enough money to buy masks. This includes farmworkers, immigrants and Native Americans. In addition to masks, the Auntie Sewing Squad distributes other supplies, such as diapers, and cleaning products.
Currently, there are sewers - or "aunties" - in Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and other US states. So far, the group has donated more than 55,000 masks! Wong isn't sure how long the Auntie Sewing Squad will continue working. But she says that as long as people in vulnerable communities need masks, the squad will keep sewing!

"I can't donate money, but I can donate masks," says Gina Rivera, a stay-at-home mom from California, USA. Rivera started making masks as a way to feel useful while in lockdown. Wearing masks has become a very important part of daily life for people around the world. But in some areas of the US, there are mask shortages. Rivera sews about 100 masks per week as part of the Auntie Sewing Squad, a major volunteer project that sews and delivers fabric masks to people who need them.
The Auntie Sewing Squad was started by actress Kristina Wong in Los Angeles, California. Due to the pandemic, all of Wong's performances were cancelled. So, Wong decided to put her creative energy into helping people who didn't have access to masks. Wong had a lot of fabric at home because she used it to make props for her shows. She took out her Hello Kitty sewing machine, and began turning the fabric into masks. Then, Wong posted a photo of herself in one of her colorful masks on social media, along with an offer to mail people free masks. She received hundreds of requests.
Wong began making masks for medical workers. But after less than a week, she realized she couldn't do it alone. So, she sent out a call for help on social media, and was flooded by responses from volunteers ready to lend a hand (and a needle!). Then, Wong launched a Facebook group called the Auntie Sewing Squad. Starting with just 26 volunteers, the group now has more than 800 sewers across the US. Today, the group helps communities where people - including farmworkers, immigrants and Native Americans - don't have enough money to purchase masks. And now, in addition to masks, the Auntie Sewing Squad distributes other essentials, such as diapers and cleaning products.
Currently, sewers - or "aunties"- in Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and other US states are sewing like crazy. So far, they have distributed more than 55,000 masks!

Restaurants around the world have had to close due to the COVID-19 crisis. But now, as countries emerge from lockdown, more people are getting out of the house to socialize. A good place to socialize is at restaurants, but restaurants are only allowed to reopen if they follow strict social distancing rules. These rules include keeping diners at least two meters apart from each other. To accomplish this, restaurant owners are coming up with creative solutions!
To keep diners at the proper distance, many restaurants limit the number of customers who may eat inside at one time. This has inspired owners to fill the empty spaces in interesting ways. Some restaurants, such as the one at Japan's Izu Shabonten Zoo, are putting stuffed animals or dolls in the empty seats. One restaurant is taking this concept even further. The Inn at Little Washington in Virginia, USA is seating life-sized mannequins at their empty tables. These mannequins, stylishly dressed in 1940's era clothing, are treated just like any other customer. Servers bring them drinks and interact with them, so the restaurant doesn't feel quite so empty! 
In other areas, customers may only eat outside the main restaurant. An intimate experience awaits at the Dutch restaurant, Mediamatic Eten. Customers sit on the patio overlooking the marina, in small glass greenhouses just big enough for two or three people. This keeps small groups of diners away from each other. Servers slide the food onto the table using long pieces of wood, keeping their distance from diners, too.
The owners of Fish Tales, in Maryland, USA, are putting one-person "bumper tables" in their 279-square-meter parking lot. Bumper tables are round tables on wheels with a hole in the middle and a large inner tube around the edge. Diners stand in the center of the table. The inner tube is so wide that it keeps diners far apart. Diners roll their table around to interact with others at a safe distance. Some other restaurant parking lots, from Germany to South Korea, are being transformed into drive-in movie theaters. At the Butler House in Texas, USA, customers text their order to the servers. Then they enjoy a movie with their meals - delivered directly to their car! 
Who knows what innovations we'll see next, as restaurants continue to find new ways to stay open while practicing safe social distancing!

Social Distancing Gets Creative

Do you miss restaurants? Because of the COVID-19 crisis, restaurants around the world have been closed. But now, restaurants are starting to reopen according to new safety rules. Social distancing means people must stay at least two meters apart from each other. How can people go to restaurants and still stay safe? Restaurants are getting creative!
In some areas, restaurants must limit the number of customers eating inside at one time. Some restaurants put stuffed animals or dolls in the empty seats. This makes the restaurant feel fuller. One restaurant, the Inn at Little Washington, in Virginia, USA is putting mannequins dressed in costumes at the empty tables. Servers treat them just like any other customers. They even talk to the mannequins, and bring them drinks!
In other areas, customers must sit outside the main restaurant. The Dutch restaurant Mediamatic Eten has small glass greenhouses. Two or three diners can sit in each greenhouse. This keeps small groups of diners away from each other. Servers keep their distance too, by serving the meal on a long, flat piece of wood.
A restaurant called Fish Tales, in Maryland, USA, put "bumper tables" in their parking lot. Bumper tables are inner tubes on wheels. Diners stand in the middle of the tube. The inner tube is so wide that customers are always two meters apart; diners can roll their tables around to interact with each other at a safe distance.
Some restaurants turned their parking lots into drive-in movie theaters. At the Butler House in Texas, USA, food is brought out to customers' cars while they watch a movie.

Mattel, Inc. is a toy company. They made the first Barbie doll in 1959. She was tall and thin. She wore a swimsuit. The first Barbie also had light skin, and blonde or brown hair.
Today, millions of children around the world play with Barbie dolls. But people don't agree about some things. For example, is Barbie good for girls? Barbie has a "perfect" body. Does this make young girls feel bad about their bodies?
In the past, people said Barbies weren't diverse. So, in 1980, Mattel made Hispanic Barbie. Next, they made dolls of other races. Then, in 2016, Mattel made Fashionista Barbie. There are 176 different Fashionista dolls. Some are tall, some are short, and some are "curvy." They have many different skin colors. One Fashionista uses a wheelchair.
Today, Barbie is over 60 years old. She has lots of clothes, friends, and accessories. And now, there are Barbie "Sheroes." These Barbies look like famous women from around the world. So, what's next for Barbie?

It's a New Barbie World
Lifestyle
Did you ever play with Barbie dolls? Barbie was "born" in 1959. This tall, thin doll wore a swimsuit and had light skin, and blonde or brown hair. Later, Barbie got clothes, accessories, and friends. Millions of children all over the world love this iconic doll.
In addition to Barbie's success, there were controversies. For example, Barbie's body caused controversy because real bodies don't look like hers. People worried that playing with Barbies might make girls feel bad about their own bodies. When Teen Talk Barbie was created in 1992, people criticized her because she said things like, "I love shopping!" and "Math is tough!"
People also criticized Mattel, Inc., the company that makes Barbie, because they thought Barbies weren't diverse enough. So, in 1980 Mattel started making Hispanic dolls. Later, they added dolls of other ethnicities. Barbie also got more than 200 inspiring jobs such as doctor, astronaut, and musician.
Then, in 2016, Mattel started making Fashionista Barbie. Mattel wanted to make each child feel like there was a doll just for her. So, there are 176 Fashionista dolls with nine different body types - tall, short, and a "curvy" body, which isn't very thin. Fashionista Barbies have 35 skin colors, and 94 hairstyles. One doll uses a wheelchair. Another has vitiligo, which means some parts of her skin are dark and some are lighter.
Today, Barbie is over 60 years old, but Mattel keeps creating new types. Barbie "Sheroes" (she + heroes) look like important women from the past and present. Tennis player Naomi Osaka, and ballerina Misty Copeland are both Sheroes. As the dolls continue to change, it seems like there's no stopping Barbie!

It's a New Barbie World
Lifestyle
Since the first Barbie doll arrived in stores in 1959, millions of children in more than 150 countries around the globe have played with them. The original Barbie had light skin and blonde or brunette hair. She was tall and slim and wore a swimsuit. Some 350,000 dolls were sold in that first year - the beginning of a phenomenon. And, of course, it wasn't just the doll for sale. Soon after, Barbie came with clothes, friends, accessories... a whole Barbie world.
However, along with Barbie's success through the years came controversies. The doll's unrealistic body, for example, was blamed for young girls having problems with body image. When Teen Talk Barbie arrived in 1992, she was criticized for saying things like, "I love shopping!" and "Math is tough!"
Barbie's lack of diversity also caused controversy. Mattel, Inc., the company that makes Barbie, responded with change. In 1980, Mattel produced Hispanic dolls, which were followed by dolls of different races and ethnicities. To promote Barbie as a role model for girls, she began to appear in a range of professions, including doctor, astronaut, firefighter, and rap musician. In fact, since Barbie's original job as "teenage fashion model," Barbie has had some 200 different careers!
Then, in 2016, to increase diversity and let every girl own a doll she could identify with, Mattel released Barbie Fashionista dolls, each with her own look and style. According to Barbie's Web site, there are 176 Fashionista dolls with nine different body types including tall, petite, and curvy, as well as 35 skin tones and 94 hairstyles. Later, dolls with physical disabilities, including a Barbie with a prosthetic leg and one in a wheelchair, were added. Mattel also wanted to include children with various conditions, so dermatologists helped create a Barbie with vitiligo, a condition that gives a person's skin "patches" of lighter and darker color.
For more than 60 years, Barbie has been an icon in the doll business. Mattel continues to inspire young girls with their "Sheroes" (she + heroes) line, which includes dolls modeled after extraordinary women from the past and present, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka and ballerina Misty Copeland. As the dolls continue to evolve, it seems like there's no stopping Barbie!

Regina Boi lives on the Italian island of Sardinia, where she works in a community bakery with eleven other women. Boi, who is in her eighties, lives in one of the world's "Blue Zones" - areas where people tend to live longer than other places - and the residents often live to celebrate their 100th birthdays!
While working for National Geographic magazine, explorer Dan Buettner noticed that there are specific places in the world where people live longer than the average. He called the areas Blue Zones and identified five of them: Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Icaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California, USA.
In addition to living longer, Buettner found that people in Blue Zones are happier and healthier. According to Buettner, their culture and way of life are responsible for this, not their genes. Buettner found that residents of Blue Zones have certain things in common, such as their diet. They all drink a lot of tea and water, and eat very little meat. Instead, their mostly plant-based diet includes a lot of vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Additionally, people in Blue Zones do a lot of physical activity. They don't go to the gym, but get exercise from routine tasks such as gardening, walking places rather than driving, and doing household chores.
Another thing people in Blue Zones have in common is being social. "You can't walk outside your front door in these regions without bumping into somebody you know, and this is all so much more powerful than we think," explains Buettner. In Blue Zone communities, grandparents often live with their children and grandchildren, which studies show can increase longevity. Elderly people are valued members of the community who continue to contribute - just like Boi, who still runs the whole bakery!
Buettner has brought Blue Zone principles to communities across the United States with his Blue Zones Project. By working with policy makers, local businesses, schools and individuals, the project has helped increase life expectancy in Blue Zones Project communities. So, what's Buettner's advice for those of us who don't live in Blue Zones? He says we should make healthier choices.
As the Sardinians say, "May you live to 100!"

Thousands of years ago in North America, Native Americans did not buy their food in a store. They grew their food.  They ate rice, corn and squash. They also hunted animals for meat. They made many different things to eat. We call Native American food "indigenous" food. Today, Native American food is becoming popular again.
Andi Murphy and Mariah Gladstone are Native American chefs. Murphy has a Web site called Toasted Sister. Gladstone has a Web site called Indigikitchen. They have recipes and videos on their Web sites. You can learn to cook Native American dishes. You can learn about Native American traditions too.

Maizie White is also a Native American with a food Web site. It is called NativeHearth. She writes about indigenous food. There are recipes on her Web site too. Why is Maizie special? She's only in seventh grade!

In the USA, people are becoming more interested in indigenous foods. Today, thanks to the growing number of Native American chefs and the Internet, indigenous foods of Native Americans are becoming more popular.
There are 566 Native American tribes that have been living in America for thousands of years. Andi Murphy is part of the Navajo tribe. You can watch her cooking videos online. In the videos, she prepares Native American food. Murphy also interviews chefs and farmers from around the US on her podcast, Toasted Sister. They talk about where Native American food comes from, and the traditions around it.
Mariah Gladstone, from the Blackfeet tribe, also uses the Internet to teach people about her culture's food. In the past, Native Americans only ate things that came from nature. For example, they ate meat (especially bison), wild rice, corn, and squash. Gladstone has a Web site called Indigikitchen. On Indigikitchen's online cooking show, Gladstone prepares Native American food including sweet wild rice with berries, blue cornmeal pancakes and butternut squash with bison. Gladstone teaches cooking classes and visits schools. She wants to educate people and get them excited about eating indigenous foods.
Blogs and cookbooks are helping to make Native American food more popular. Recently, Sean Sherman's cookbook, The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, was named "The Best American Cookbook". Sherman wants to encourage younger chefs. He invited Maizie White, a seventh grader from the Mohawk tribe, to cook with him. Maizie has her own blog called NativeHearth where she posts recipes and writes about indigenous food.

Welcome to Indigenous Cooking
Lifestyle
For thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in North America, Native Americans developed their own culture and lifestyle. Today in the USA, people are becoming interested in the foods that the indigenous people ate at that time. Thanks to a growing number of Native American chefs and the Internet, Native American food, known as "the first truly American cuisine," is being revived.
Native Americans in the USA come from 566 recognized tribes. Food journalist Andi Murphy, a member of the Navajo tribe, says, "I want to show the beauty and simplicity of Native food." In addition to creating online videos of Native dishes being prepared, Murphy hosts Toasted Sister, a podcast where she interviews chefs, farmers and foodies from around the USA. The discussions focus on the development of Native American cuisine, and how food connects Native Americans to their origins and traditions.   
Mariah Gladstone, from the Blackfeet tribe, also uses the Internet to celebrate her culture's food through her Web site, Indigikitchen. In the past, Native Americans had a varied diet that Gladstone explains "came from the land," including meat (especially bison), wild rice, corn, and squash. On Indigikitchen's online cooking show, Gladstone prepares dishes that combine indigenous foods with modern ingredients. In some of her more popular videos, she makes sweet wild rice with berries, blue cornmeal pancakes, and butternut squash with bison. Additionally, Indigikitchen runs cooking workshops and school programs, and supports Native American food producers. Gladstone's goal is to teach people about indigenous foods, and to get Native and non-Native Americans excited about eating them. She also hopes eating traditional foods will improve Native Americans' health. For example, as a result of their changing diets, many Native Americans have developed diabetes.
Blogs and cookbooks are helping to popularize Native American cuisine. Recently, Chef Sean Sherman's cookbook, The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, won a national prize for best American cookbook. Sherman wants to encourage younger chefs. He invited Maizie White, a seventh grader from the Mohawk tribe, to come cook with him in New York. Maizie, who has her own blog called NativeHearth, posts recipes and writes about Native American food traditions.

Welcome To The Doodle House!
Arts & Entertainment
Have you ever drawn simple pictures or designs during a work meeting or during a class? Then you've doodled! When Sam Cox was nine years old, he doodled on his bedroom wall. Many people outgrow doodling, but Cox never did; he became a successful British artist. Cox's childhood dream was to live in a house completely covered in doodles. Recently, with the "Doodle House," he made his dream come true!
The Doodle House looks very different from other houses in Kent, England. It has been doodled, inside and out! Cox's art looks like cute, black-on-white cartoons. He uses simple, thick lines to create symbols and characters wearing funny expressions. Cox bought the 13-room home in 2019. Then, he covered every bit of it with white paint - he used 900 liters! Next, Cox grabbed a black marker and started doodling on the white surfaces. He began upstairs in the main bedroom, and then moved on to the bathroom. Eventually, he finished the entire upper floor. Cox spent almost two years drawing over every square centimeter of the house!
Cox didn't only doodle on the walls, floors and ceilings of the house - he doodled on the furnishings too! Doodled beds have doodled blankets and pillows. In the kitchen, the stove and refrigerator have been doodled. The dining room chairs and table have doodles. Cox doodled the sofa in his living room as well as the television! Finally, when Cox had finished all the rooms in the house, he used 401 cans of black spray paint to add doodles to the outside!
Each part of the Doodle House has a theme. In the bedroom, flowers, stars and other characters get ready for bed. Fish and other sea creatures float around a water-themed bathroom, along with a giant toothbrush. There's even a "thinking" room filled with fluffy clouds!
Cox (known as "Mr. Doodle") loves living in the Doodle House with his wife Alena ("Mrs. Doodle"), and their dog, "We think it's really fun," he says. The public can't visit yet, but there is an online video Cox made using the nearly 2,000 photos he took while painting the house. "I am so excited that my doodles now have a permanent home in the UK," says Mr. Doodle.

Do you bake cakes? Each year, the Blanton Museum of Art (in Texas, USA) has a baking contest. It's called the Great Blanton Bake-Off. The museum started the contest during the COVID pandemic. It helped people get excited about the museum.
The museum has more than 19,000 pieces of art. To enter the contest, choose your favorite piece of art on the museum's Web site. Then, bake and decorate your cake. Make it look like the artwork. Next, send the museum a photo of your cake. The museum shares all the photos online. People vote for the cake they think looks the best. Some contestants bake just for fun. Others are professional bakers. Contestants can be any age. Winners get prizes.
Lois Rodriguez baked a cake that looked like the sculpture The Barefoot Clown. The cake looked like a foot. Georgia Chido is a teenager. She made a chocolate cake with a colorful pattern. It looked like artwork by artist Luis Montiel. Chido's cake won a prize! Can you make a cake "masterpiece"?

Like many museums around the world, the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, USA, was closed during the COVID pandemic. Back then, the only way to "visit" the artwork was online. But the museum wanted to keep people interested in their collection - more than 19,000 pieces of artwork. So, they started a baking competition called the Great Blanton Bake-Off. In the competition, contestants choose a piece of art from the museum's collection. Then, they make a cake that looks like the artwork!
Bake-Off contestants send photos of their cakes to the museum. Then the museum shares the photos online. People look at the photos. They vote online for the cake they think looks the best. You don't have to be a professional baker to be in the competition. And contestants of all ages are welcome. Winners get prizes from local bakeries.
Fifteen-year-old Georgia Chido was a recent winner. She liked a tapestry by Venezuelan artist Luis Montiel. A tapestry is a piece of heavy cloth with a picture on it. Chido made a round, chocolate cake. Then, she used different colored food dyes to make the pattern from the tapestry. Lois Rodriguez made a vanilla cake shaped like a foot. She was inspired by the artwork The Barefoot Clown. Rodriguez says it was hard to make the colors on her cake match the colors in the artwork.
Lizabel Stella is the museum's social media manager, and the creator of the Bake-Off. She's thrilled with the success of the competition. "This is a completely new way for people to engage with art from our collection," she says.

You may have seen cake baking competitions on television or online. Perhaps you've seen the TV show where contestants bake cakes that look like everyday objects - from shoes to bottles of soap! But there's another creative cake competition you might have missed. It's run by the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, USA, and it's called the Great Blanton Bake-Off. In the competition, contestants bake cakes that look like pieces of artwork from the museum's collection!
The Great Blanton Bake-Off is the brainchild of Lizabel Stella, the museum's social media manager. Stella was looking for a way to keep people interested in art, and in the museum, when it was closed during the pandemic. During this time, Stella noticed that many people were posting baking videos on social media. This inspired Stella to create the Bake-Off.
For the Great Blanton Bake-Off, contestants create a cake that looks like one of the museum's more than 19,000 works of art. The collection includes European paintings, prints and drawings, and American and Latin American art. To choose a piece of artwork, participants can go to the museum, or browse the collection online.
When contestants finish their cakes, they take photos of their "masterpieces" and send them to the museum. Then, on World Baking Day (celebrated in May) the museum shares the photos online, and the public votes for the best-looking cake. Bake-Off winners receive prizes from local pastry shops, and memberships to the museum.
Recently, contestant Lois Rodriguez made a vanilla cake shaped like a foot. It was inspired by the sculpture The Barefoot Clown by artist Tr� Arenz. "Getting the colors close [to the original artwork] was a real challenge," says Rodriguez.
The contest is open to professional and amateur bakers of all ages. It took 15-year-old Georgia Chido two days to make her round, gluten-free cake with chocolate icing. Chido used different colored food dyes to recreate the pattern of a tapestry by Venezuelan artist Luis Montiel. Chido's cake won!
Stella is thrilled with the success of the Blanton Bake-Off. "This is a completely new way for people to engage with art from our collection," she says.





Ping Sie, from Singapore, never expected to find her picture in a fashion magazine. She has some wrinkles and never wears makeup. But after working in her family's business for many years, she decided to change careers. At age 58, Sie became a model. Sie is part of a shift in the modeling industry towards models who don't fit the idea of a "traditional" fashion model. These agencies want models who look "real," and have a great personality. They believe stressing a model's individuality makes them more interesting to people. At agency Web sites and on social media, you can find out how models spend their time away from the camera.
Most "traditional" models look fresh and young. "I would say once you're in your early 30's, it's time to 'hang up your high heels'," says Pat Kraal, the managing director of Platinum Angels Management (PAM). Based in Singapore, PAM is the first modeling agency in Asia whose models are all over the age of 50. With an emphasis on personality, PAM has almost no physical requirements to join. Kraal says PAM's models inspire people to look beyond a person's age. "It is not the end of the world just because you're 60 - it's just the beginning!"
Unlike PAM's models, who often have gray hair, models at Anti-Agency, in the UK, are more likely to have rainbow-colored hair - or no hair at all! Anti-Agency represents models with quirkier looks. Many of them have body piercings or tattoos - things usually frowned upon in traditional modeling. The agency looks for creative individuals, such as musicians and painters, who also have the talent to model. There are no height or weight requirements.
After working for other agencies for years, Rene Gonzalez decided to start State, a modeling agency for a new generation of models. Their roster of models includes people of all body types. Additionally, State expects their fashion models to be role models. Model Kendall Baisden, for example, was an honors student in college, is a star athlete, and wants to inspire people to follow their dreams.
When looking for models, unconventional modeling agencies work outside the standard idea of beauty. After all, beauty is only skin deep!

Ping Sie, from Singapore, has wrinkles and never wears makeup. But Sie just started a surprising new career. At age 58, she became a fashion model! Today, many advertisers are looking for untraditional models (who are not tall, thin, and young). So, more and more modeling agencies are finding work for untraditional fashion models. These agencies are searching for models with interesting looks and great personalities. They believe a model's personality makes them more interesting to advertisers. In fact, agency Web sites tell you how models spend their free time away from modeling.
The agency Sie works for is Platinum Angels Management (PAM). PAM is the first modeling agency in Asia whose models are all over the age of 50. Pat Kraal runs PAM. She hopes PAM's models will inspire people of all ages to enjoy life. "It is not the end of the world just because you're 60 - it's just the beginning!" says Kraal.
Similarly, Anti-Agency, a modeling agency in the UK, is more interested in a model's personality than in their appearance. The agency looks for musicians, painters, and other creative people. Unlike traditional models, many Anti-Agency models proudly show body piercings or tattoos. And models don't need to be a certain height or weight.
State modeling agency has models of all different body types too. But State also wants fashion models who people can look up to. For example, Kendall Baisden, one of their models, got top grades in college and is a professional athlete. Baisden wants to inspire people to follow their dreams.
As the fashion industry continues to change, model agencies will change too.

We see a lot of ads every day. The ads try to sell us things. Many ads use models. Most models are very tall and thin. Most models are young. But now, ads are changing. Companies want models that look like "real" people. So, modeling agencies are looking for all kinds of people. Some have wrinkles. Some have a lot of body piercings.
Platinum Angels Management is a modeling agency in Singapore. All their models are older than 50. The agency has a message: older people can enjoy life too!
Another special modeling agency is Anti-Agency. It is in the UK. Anti-Agency wants models who are creative. Some of their models are musicians. Some models are painters. Many models have tattoos.
At the State modeling agency, models have all different body types. But State also wants models who inspire people. So, they look for models with interesting lives. One model, Kendall, is an excellent student. She is also an athlete.

Most art museums don't show all their art. They don't have enough space. They put most art in storage. So, museum visitors don't see that art. Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen wants to show all their art at once (more than 151,000 objects). So, they built storage that people can visit. The new building is called the "Depot." It's in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
Inside, the Depot has lots of glass. The art is in glass display cases. The cases protect the art. Visitors walk over glass bridges. They also ride in glass elevators. Visitors watch restorers working behind glass walls. Restorers take care of the art, so it lasts a long time. The Depot has all kinds of art. There is furniture. There are ceramic objects. There are paintings by famous artists.
Outside, the Depot has mirrors all over it. People think the Depot looks like a giant silver bowl. The shiny building is 39.5 meters high. On top of the Depot there are trees and grass. There is also a restaurant. Visitors enjoy the Depot.

Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen is in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This famous museum has more than 151,000 pieces of artwork. Visitors can see all types of art - furniture, ceramics and paintings, including pieces by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and more. But the museum isn't large enough to show everything at once. In the past, most of the art was kept in different storage facilities.
But today, the museum has one big storage facility, called Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen. The "Depot" is the first art storage facility in the world to be open to the public, allowing visitors to view the museum's entire collection.
The 39.5 meters-high Depot is next to the main museum building. Its curved sides are covered in 1,664 mirrors, making it look like a giant silver bowl. On top of the Depot are trees and grass. There is also a restaurant with an amazing view of the city.
In the Depot, the art is organized in a special way - according to materials. Pieces of art made from the same materials are kept in the same compartment. Each compartment has a different climate. For example, paintings may be in one compartment and silver objects in another.
The Depot is filled with glass cases in different shapes and sizes. The cases protect the art, and allow visitors to see it. To view the art, visitors walk over glass bridges and climb stairs. They can also ride the glass elevators. Visitors can even look behind glass walls to watch art restorers at work, making sure the art stays in good condition. The Depot lets visitors experience art in a new and interesting way.

Like many world-famous art museums, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, in the Netherlands, had a space problem. Their building wasn't large enough to display all their artwork at once. Visitors were only able to view a small fraction (around 8%) of the collection. The rest of the more than 151,000 pieces were in various storage facilities. So, they came up with a unique solution - the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen. It's an art storage facility open to the public, which allows visitors to view the museum's entire collection.
The "Depot" looks like a giant silver bowl. Standing 39.5 meters high, the structure is covered in 1,664 mirrors. Its shiny, curved surface reflects the main museum building, which sits right next to the Depot. On top of the Depot, you'll find a rooftop forest with trees and grass, and a restaurant with a view of the Rotterdam cityscape.
It took 16 weeks to transfer all the precious pieces of art into the Depot. The museum's collection spans the history of Western art from the Middle Ages till today. There is furniture, ceramics, and paintings, including masterpieces by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and more.
In the main museum building, objects are organized by time period or art style. But in the Depot, they're organized according to the materials they're made from. There are sections for paintings, metal objects, organic and non-organic materials, and black-and-white and color photography. Each section has its own climate, to keep each type of material at the proper temperature, so the artwork is preserved.
Inside, the Depot is made mostly of glass and other transparent materials. There are glass display cases in different shapes and sizes, and stairs and glass elevators help people move around the building. You can see the exhibits at all angles, and even walk on top of them, or see them below from the glass bridges.
At the Depot, not only art is on display; the staff is too! There are four studios where curators, restorers, and other employees work behind glass walls. Visitors get a behind-the-scenes look at the activities involved in taking care of the artwork. At the Depot, visitors can not only view lots of art, but experience art in a new, and interesting way.




Very "Cool" Art

Simon Beck walks for kilometers through a field of thick snow in Norway. As he walks, he creates a huge, detailed design. Beck is an artist, and his "canvas" is snow.
Beck "draws" or "carves out" his designs by walking on top of the snow with snowshoes. Once, he drew a four-leaf clover on a frozen reservoir in France. It was the size of six soccer fields, and took him 32 hours to complete!
Beck made his first piece of snow art after a day of skiing in 2004. He went to a field of freshly fallen snow in the French alps, where he lived. Using a compass, he measured five points around a central point and joined the dots, creating a five-pointed star. After that first snow drawing, Beck kept going, making more complicated designs each time.
Beck always follows the same routine. He uses a compass as a guide, and carves out the main lines of the design. Then he fills in smaller lines and shades the outer part of the drawing.
Many of Beck's designs are geometric. He once drew a huge triangle with many smaller triangles inside it.
He also drew a 450-meter geometric snowflake, which took over six hours of work! But Beck draws in other styles too. In Canada, he made a wolf howling at the moon. In Siberia, he made a dragon with giant wings.
From above, some of Beck's designs look three-dimensional. Beck gets excited to see his finished creations from a high vantage point. "There's always a sense of anticipation," he says, "because you never really know what it's going to look like until you see it."
Beck has created snow art in countries around the globe. So far, he has created more than 370 snow drawings. And Beck is not limited to snow. He draws in sand too, using a rake instead of snowshoes to carve out designs. Beck has created about 200 sand drawings so far.
It doesn't bother the artist that his drawings get blown away by wind and washed away by water. But since they won't last forever, he photographs each piece. Although his artwork is temporary, Beck loves what he does, and plans to continue making art - one footprint at a time!

In 2004, Beck made his first snow drawing - a five-pointed star. First, he took a compass to an empty field of snow. Using the compass, Beck measured out even lines in the snow. Then, he began walking along the lines. As he walked, his feet "drew" the star. Since then, this artist has created more than 370 snow drawings.
Beck's designs are complex. Although they're all different, he makes them the same way each time. First, he makes the main lines of the design. Then, he adds smaller lines for detail. Finally, he does the outer part of the drawing. Many of Beck's designs are geometric, like the snowflake. From high above, some of his pictures even look three-dimensional.
Beck also draws creatures. In Canada, he drew a wolf. In Siberia, he drew a dragon with giant wings. Beck's art has been seen in the French Alps, Norway, and many other snowy places.
And Beck doesn't only draw in snow. He draws in sand too. He uses a rake to draw the designs instead of snowshoes. Beck has created about 200 sand drawings so far.
Beck's art is only temporary - snow melts and sand gets washed away - so Beck photographs each drawing. This way, his art never truly disappears.

Very "Cool" Art
Arts & Entertainment
Simon Beck loves the snow. He's a snow artist. Beck "draws" pictures in the snow with his feet and snowshoes.
First, Beck draws a picture on paper. Then, he goes to a space with lots of snow. Next, Beck looks at the picture, and draws it with his feet. When a line in the picture goes left, Beck walks left. When the picture shows a circle, Beck walks in a circle. Beck's snowshoes help him stay on top of the snow.
Beck's first snow picture was a star. He made the star in the French Alps, in 2004. Beck's pictures are very big. He may walk for many kilometers to make them. Once, Beck walked for six hours to draw a snowflake. It was 450-meters long!
Beck makes snow drawings all over the world. In Canada, he drew a wolf. In Siberia, he drew a dragon with large wings. Beck drew more than 370 snow drawings so far.
But snow melts, and Beck's art disappears. So, Beck photographs every snow drawing.




The Laughter Lab
Arts & Entertainment
What makes us laugh? Robin Dunbar wants to find out. Dunbar is a psychologist. He is studying laughter. Emma Stirling-Middleton works at the The Cartoon Museum in London. She also wants to learn about laughter. Stirling-Middleton asked Dunbar to help her create an exhibit at The Cartoon Museum. The exhibit is called Laughter Lab: What's So Funny?.
At the exhibit, there are many kinds of cartoons. Some cartoons are in black and white. Other cartoons are in color. The cartoons hang on the wall in pairs. Visitors look at a pair of cartoons. They decide which cartoon is funnier. Then they write this information down on a survey. They do this for every pair of cartoons. There are 19 pairs altogether.
Scientists will read the surveys. The surveys will tell scientists which cartoons made people laugh the most. Scientists will try to find out why.
Visit the Laughter Lab exhibit soon. You'll help scientists. And best of all, you'll laugh!

The Laughter Lab

Do you like funny drawings, called cartoons? You can see many cartoons, from all different time periods, at The Cartoon Museum, in London. The museum has more than 6,000 original cartoons. Recently, curators chose some of these pieces for an interesting exhibit, called Laughter Lab: What's So Funny? The exhibit is also an experiment. Its purpose is to find out what makes us laugh, and why we laugh at some cartoons and not others.
At the Laughter Lab, visitors see a variety of cartoons. Some are in black and white. Others are in color. The cartoons are arranged in sets of two. Each cartoon in a pair is marked with an "A" or "B." Visitors walk around the exhibit. From each pair, they pick the cartoon they think is funnier. Then, they write "A" or "B" on the survey. When the exhibit ends, after six months, scientists will study the results.
The Laughter Lab was created by Robin Dunbar and Emma Stirling-Middleton. Dunbar is a University of Oxford psychologist. Stirling-Middleton is a curator of The Cartoon Museum. The Laughter Lab was Stirling-Middleton's idea. "I thought... it would be really nice to do an exhibition looking at laughter," she says.
At first, Stirling-Middleton had difficulty finding a scientist to work with her on the project; there aren't many scientists studying laughter. But finally, she found Dunbar. Dunbar does research on laughter. He'll be in charge of analyzing the surveys. Both Dunbar and Stirling-Middleton are interested in the psychology behind the humor in cartoons. They also want the exhibit to be fun.
Visit the Laughter Lab soon. You'll help scientists and have a laugh!

The Laughter Lab
Arts & Entertainment
Why do we laugh at some jokes and not others? Visitors to The Cartoon Museum, in London, can help scientists find out! Laughter Lab: What's So Funny? is part exhibit, part scientific experiment. Researchers want to find out what it is that really makes humans laugh. And The Cartoon Museum is the perfect place to uncover the answers.
The wide selection of cartoons in the Laughter Lab exhibit were chosen from the museum's more than 6,000 pieces of artwork. Some of the cartoons are drawn in black and white; others are in color. In one black and white cartoon, an ant tells the ant next to it, "It's too quiet." Meanwhile, a huge anteater is silently floating in the air, sneaking up behind them. In another cartoon, a group of newborn babies look surprised to see a dog among them.
As visitors laugh their way around the exhibit, they'll see the pictures arranged in numbered pairs. Each cartoon in the pair is marked "A" or "B."  From each pair, visitors choose the cartoon they think is funnier. They record their reactions on a survey provided by the museum. When the Laughter Lab ends, after about six months, the results of the survey will be analyzed, and published by University of Oxford psychologist Robin Dunbar.
Dunbar, who helped create the exhibit, says that laughter is important for humans' everyday social lives. Dunbar has already done research on what makes comedians' jokes funny. One of his findings is that jokes are funnier when they have only two characters and aren't too complex; Dunbar wonders if the Laughter Lab's experiment will show similar results.
Dunbar worked on the Laughter Lab together with The Cartoon Museum curator Emma Stirling-Middleton. It was actually Stirling-Middleton's idea to create the exhibit. "I thought... it would be really nice to do an exhibition looking at laughter," she says.
At first, Stirling-Middleton had difficulty finding scientists to work with her on the project, as there aren't many scientists studying laughter. But luckily, she eventually found Dunbar. Stirling-Middleton is interested in the psychology behind the humor in cartoons, but she says that for her, the exhibit is mostly about having fun.





Each year, millions of tourists flock to Italy to view Renaissance masterpieces, such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper and Michelangelo's David. Through the centuries, these and other priceless pieces of art have become covered in layers of dirt and grime. To clean them, art restorers have developed different techniques, using various chemicals and even lasers. Recently, however, some of Michelangelo's 16th-century marble sculptures were cleaned in a different way - using bacteria!
Bacteria are very small living things that you can only see under a microscope. Using bacteria to clean the surface of stonework and artwork is called "biocleaning." In the last two decades, research has shown that biocleaning has advantages over traditional cleaning methods. It's more eco-friendly, for example, as using bacteria is a more natural process. And chemicals can actually harm the artwork while cleaning it.
In the biocleaning process, a gel containing the bacteria is applied to the surface. The gel stays on anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks, while the bacteria eat the dirt. Then, the gel is peeled back, and the surface is wiped off. Finally, the artwork is tested to ensure that no bacteria were left behind. "It's better for our health, for the environment, and the works of art," says art restorer Daniela Manna, about biocleaning.
Manna was part of an all-woman team of scientists, restorers, and historians who worked on the Michelangelo sculptures in the Medici Chapel, in Florence. In the lab, the biologists tested almost 1,000 strains to find the right bacteria to clean the marble - one that would eat the grime, but not the stone itself.
People often associate bacteria with negative things, such as illness. But Silvia Borghini, conservator at the National Roman Museum, in Rome, doesn't think bacteria deserve their bad reputation. "More than 95 percent of bacteria are not harmful to humans," says Borghini. Borghini recently used a strain of bacteria to clean a block of marble from a 4th-century Roman bridge. The marble sits in the garden of the museum.
Artifacts need to be protected from the ravages of time. Biocleaning is one interesting way to clean and restore important pieces of cultural heritage. It shows what is possible when we harness the power of the natural world.

Bacteria to the Rescue!
Arts & Entertainment
Have you ever seen Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper or Michelangelo's David? These are beautiful pieces of art from the Renaissance. To keep old artwork beautiful, art restorers need to take care of them.  One job of an art restorer is to clean the artwork. To do this, they often use chemicals or lasers. Recently, however, some art restorers have been using an unusual cleaning material - bacteria! Bacteria are very small living things that you can only see under a microscope.
Using bacteria to clean art is called "biocleaning." Unlike chemicals, bacteria don't damage artwork. Bacteria are also more eco-friendly than chemicals. "It's better for our health, for the environment, and the works of art," says art restorer Daniela Manna about biocleaning.
To begin cleaning, art restorers put a gel containing the bacteria onto the artwork. They leave the gel on for anywhere between a few hours and a few weeks. Meanwhile, the bacteria eat the dirt. Finally, the gel is wiped away.
Manna was part of an all-woman team that cleaned some of Michelangelo's 16th-century marble sculptures in Florence, Italy. They tested almost 1,000 strains to find the right bacteria - one that would eat the dirt, but not the stone itself. Bacteria were also recently used to clean part of a 4th-century Roman bridge. The large piece of marble from the bridge sits in the garden of the National Roman Museum, in Rome.
Renaissance paintings and sculptures are important cultural artifacts. They should be protected for the future. With bacteria, restorers have another tool to use in their fight against time.

Bacteria to the Rescue!
Arts & Entertainment
Did you ever see the art of Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo? Their art is from the Renaissance. The art is very old. Someone needs to clean the art, to keep it beautiful. This is the job of an art restorer.
Sometimes art restorers clean art with lasers. Sometimes they use chemicals. But chemicals can harm the artwork. And chemicals aren't good for the environment. Now, there is a natural way to clean art - with bacteria!
Bacteria are tiny living things. The restorers put bacteria on the art. The bacteria eat all the dirt.
Daniela Manna is an art restorer. Manna used bacteria to clean 16th-century sculptures. Scientists tested almost 1,000 kinds of bacteria for Manna. They finally found the right bacteria for Manna's project. The bacteria ate the dirt, but didn't harm the sculptures.
Some people think bacteria are bad. But restorers like Manna say bacteria are helpful. She says that cleaning with bacteria is "better for our health, for the environment, and the works of art."





What will happen in the future? Find out at the Smithsonian Institution, in the USA! The museum has a new exhibition called Futures. The exhibition teaches visitors about the future and the past.
Futures has four themes. One theme is Futures Past. Here, you can see a telephone that Alexander Graham Bell invented in 1876. You can also see a Bakelizer - one of the first machines that made plastic.
The Futures that Work section is about the environment. Visitors can try a special washing machine. It's next to a small garden. The machine washes clothes. Then, it pours the water into the garden so the plants grow.
Futures that Unite is about people working together. In one activity, you play a computer game. In the game, you plan a neighborhood. For example, you may put a park in your neighborhood.
Futures that Inspire has very new inventions. There is meat that grows like a plant. There is a taxi that can drive by itself, and fly!
Futures shows us that many things are possible.

Welcome to the Future(s)!

The Smithsonian Institution, site of the first national museum in the USA, recently had its 175th anniversary. To celebrate, they opened a new exhibition called Futures. Futures has nearly 150 items on display that connect the past to the future. There's artwork and historic objects. Visitors can also see some of the world's newest inventions.
The exhibition is taking place in the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building (AIB). AIB, one of the Smithsonian's oldest buildings, has four separate wings. For Futures, each wing of the AIB has its own theme.
In the Futures Past wing, visitors can see an early prototype of the first telephone, from 1876, made by Alexander Graham Bell. Another historic invention is the Bakelizer machine, one of the first machines to make plastic.
Futures that Work focuses on the environment. One exhibit is an eco-friendly coin-operated washing machine. Used water goes from the machine into a small garden right next to it, helping the plants grow. Visitors can try out the machine with their own coins and laundry!
The Futures that Unite wing focuses on ways we connect with each other. In one activity, visitors use special computer software to design their own neighborhoods. They can add parks to their neighborhood, for example.
The section that feels the most like science-fiction is Futures that Inspire. There, visitors see new kinds of food products, such as meat grown like mushrooms, and an insect-based snack food. There's also the Bell Nexus, a self-driving taxi that can fly!
No one can know what tomorrow will bring, but at Futures visitors can explore the possibilities.

Besides inventions, there are also interactive displays, historic artifacts, and artwork. Futures includes objects and displays the Smithsonian hopes will inspire visitors to think about the kind of future they want to live in.
Visiting Futures feels like attending a World's Fair from the 18th or 19th century. Back then, these fairs were the only place for the public to see the world's latest technologies and scientific developments. Futures is part of the Smithsonian's 175th anniversary celebration.
The exhibition is located in the museum's Arts and Industries Building (AIB). The AIB opened in 1881 and was the site of the first national museum in the USA. The AIB has four separate wings - each with its own theme. In the Futures Past wing, there are displays of historical innovations and ideas. You can see Alexander Graham Bell's experimental telephone from 1876, and the Bakelizer, from 1909 - one of the first machines to make plastic.
The Futures that Work section looks at ideas related to labor and helping the environment. One of the highlights is an eco-friendly, coin-operated washing machine. The machine's wastewater is used to grow a garden of plants in the tank next to it. Visitors can bring their own coins and laundry to test it out!
The Futures that Unite wing focuses on ways for people to connect with each other. This wing includes interactive touch-screen displays where visitors play a game called "Future Communities." Special computer software helps them generate their ideal neighborhood.
The section that feels the most like science-fiction is Futures that Inspire. Visitors can see new kinds of food products, such as meat grown like mushrooms, and an insect-based snack food. There's also a model of a city built on the ocean, and the Bell Nexus, a self-driving taxi that can fly!
 
No one can know what tomorrow will bring, but at Futures visitors can explore the possibilities. Monica Montgomery, a Smithsonian curator, says, it's "... 100% the most fun you can have in a museum."
 




A Movie That's Out of this World!
Arts & Entertainment
Russian actress Yulia Peresild has appeared in many movies, but none were as thrilling to make as her latest movie, The Challenge. In The Challenge, Peresild plays a doctor who travels to the International Space Station (ISS) to treat one of the cosmonauts. But it isn't just the plot that makes this movie exciting; some scenes were actually filmed in space!
In 2020, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, held a competition to choose an actress to star in what would be the first feature-length drama filmed partially in space. Peresild won the competition, beating out thousands of other actresses for the role. Along with Peresild, Roscosmos sent Klim Shipenko, a well-known Russian director, and Anton Shkaplerov, an experienced cosmonaut, to film on the ISS.
Professional astronauts spend years getting ready for space. But for their brief 12-day period of filming, Peresild and Shipenko trained for just three months! It was a rigorous training program, however. Peresild and Shipenko took flights in zero gravity, learned how to use a parachute, and were trained in the basics of space survival. They also practiced for emergencies that could happen after they left Earth. In fact, as their spacecraft was arriving at the ISS dock, there was an emergency, and Shkaplerov had to briefly take over the controls!
Since Shipenko couldn't bring a whole film crew into space, he did a lot more than direct the film. Shipenko also handled the cameras, lighting, sound, and makeup. And Shkaplerov and other cosmonauts pitched in too, working as actors in the movie. Cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky played the role of the man whose life Peresild's character tries to save.
 
While other, shorter, movies have already been filmed on board the ISS, such as a documentary, The Challenge was the first feature-film filmed there. Roscosmos hopes the project will show how space travel is becoming available to a wider range of people, not just astronauts. In the future, there may be more entertainment filmed on the ISS. Are you ready to watch a reality TV show called Who Wants to Be an Astronaut?

Yulia Peresild is a well-known Russian actress. Her latest movie is called The Challenge. In the movie, Peresild plays a doctor who travels to the International Space Station (ISS) to help a cosmonaut. But there is something extra special about Peresild's new movie. The Challenge is the first feature film with scenes filmed in space!
Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, is in charge of the movie project. In 2020, Roscosmos held a competition to choose the star of The Challenge. Peresild won. Along with Peresild, Roscosmos sent director Klim Shipenko to film on the ISS, and Anton Shkaplerov, an experienced cosmonaut too.
While cosmonauts spend years getting ready for space travel, Peresild and Shipenko's training took only three months. But it was very difficult. Peresild and Shipenko took flights in zero gravity. They learned to use a parachute, and how to drink water and wash their hair in space. The pair also practiced what to do in case of emergency. And there was an actual emergency. Their spacecraft had a problem on the way to the ISS. Thankfully, Shkaplerov was able to finish flying the ship to the ISS safely.
Usually, it takes a lot of people to make a movie. But there isn't a lot of room on the ISS. So, in addition to directing, Shipenko had to use cameras, adjust the lights, and help with makeup. Shkaplerov and other cosmonauts helped out too - they appeared as actors in the movie!
 
In the future, other types of entertainment will be filmed on the ISS. Get ready for television shows, as well as other movies which are in the works. Three, two, one... blast off!

A painting of a girl letting go of (or reaching for) a red, heart-shaped balloon appeared under a London bridge in 2002. Who created this image? The world-famous British graffiti artist Banksy, who is known for his stenciled street art. His spray-painted, stenciled works have covered walls of buildings, trains, bridges, and other public surfaces around the world.
Banksy isn't his real name. Almost no one knows who Banksy really is, or what he looks like. Banksy hides his identity. Staying anonymous helps him do his work in secret, since spray painting on public surfaces is illegal. Staying anonymous also makes Banksy more mysterious.
We do know that Banksy used to call himself "Robin Banx" (sounds like "robbing banks"), but then shortened it to Banksy. Banksy started making street art in the 1990s, in Bristol, England, and moved to London around 1999. By 2001, Banksy's artwork was popping up across the UK.
Aside from street art, Banksy has created sculptures and paintings on canvas. Today, Banksy's street art is respected in much of the art world. In the early 2000s, Banksy's artwork sold for a few thousand dollars. Then, prices for his artwork began to soar. In 2019, his oil painting Devolved Parliament sold for $12.1 million dollars!
After Banksy's Girl With Balloon bridge artwork became famous, Banksy painted the same image on canvas. In 2018, the auction house Sotheby's put it up for sale. As soon as it was sold, for $1.4 million dollars, a shredder hidden inside the frame shredded most of the painting! This stunt actually made the painting more valuable. Today, that partially shredded painting might be worth as much as $2.8 million dollars!
Banksy has pulled other stunts too. In 2003, he started smuggling his own works into museums. In the Louvre in Paris, he left a painting of the Mona Lisa with a smiley face where her face should be. At the British Museum, he left a rock with an image of a caveman pushing a shopping cart. It took three days before anyone even noticed!
There are many theories about Banksy's true identity. But most of his fans don't even want to know it. They prefer wondering who he is, and where his artwork will pop up next!

Banksy isn't his real name. Almost no one knows who Banksy really is. Banksy hides his true identity. Spray painting on buildings without permission is illegal. Hiding his identity allows Banksy to work in secret. It also adds to his mystery.
We do know that Banksy started making street art in the 1990s, in Bristol, England. At first, he called himself "Robin Banx." Then he shortened it to "Banksy." By 2001, Banksy's artwork was showing up in public places across the UK.
Besides street art, Banksy has created sculptures and paintings on canvas. In one painting, Girl With Balloon, a girl lets go of a red, heart-shaped balloon. In 2018, this painting was sold at auction for $1.4 million dollars. However, as soon as it was sold, it started getting shredded. Banksy had hidden a shredder inside the picture frame! This stunt actually made the painting even more valuable. Today, that shredded painting might be worth as much as $2.8 million dollars.
Banksy has done other stunts too. He took a picture of the Mona Lisa and put a smiley face on the Mona Lisa's face. Then, he hung it in the Louvre Museum in Paris! He sneaked artwork into museums in New York and London too.
People have been trying to discover Banksy's true identity for years. But many fans don't even want to know. They only want to know where Banksy's artwork will show up next!

Serious chess players can compete for years trying to earn a "master" title, but Adewumi had been playing chess for only about three years when he won the title.
Adewumi, now 11, was born in Nigeria. In 2017, he and his family came as refugees to New York, USA. Having nowhere to go, they lived in a homeless shelter. Adewumi enrolled in elementary school, and that's when his chess journey began.
In school, a teacher taught Adewumi how to play chess. Adewumi really enjoyed the game and wanted to join the school chess club, but his family couldn't afford it. When the coaches learned about Adewumi's situation, they waived the club's $330 fee. Shawn Martinez, Adewumi's coach, says he saw the boy's potential right away. "He has an incredible memory and he's very interested in what he's learning."
Adewumi practiced chess for hours in the evenings at the shelter. He also began competing - and winning trophies. Then, less than a year after he learned to play, Adewumi beat 73 other players to win the New York State chess championship! Winning the championship would change the lives of Adewumi and his family forever. 
After the state championship, Adewumi's coaches set up an online campaign to raise money for his family. Then, there was an article about Adewumi in the New York Times. People all over the world heard his inspiring story. Eventually, the campaign raised more than $250,000 dollars! There was even one donor who decided to pay the family's rent for a year on a two-bedroom apartment. This allowed the chess champion and his family to finally move out of the homeless shelter.
Today, Adewumi practices every day after school for about 10 hours. He also studies books about famous chess masters, and plays chess online. When Adewumi loses, he takes it in stride, and learns from his mistakes. "I say to myself that I never lose, that I only learn."




Saori Fujimoto: Sign Language Artist

What do BTS, GOT7, and Blackpink have in common? They are all famous K-pop bands. K-pop (Korean popular music) has become a global sensation. People everywhere love the bands' catchy tunes, exciting videos, and perfectly synchronized dancing. The all-male BTS is currently one of the most successful bands on the planet. Their song Dynamite has been viewed over 1 billion times! Now, deaf and hard-of-hearing people can enjoy the music too, thanks to a Japanese woman named Saori Fujimoto. Fujimoto posts videos of herself interpreting K-pop songs in unique ways using sign language.
You see sign language interpreters in many places, such as on television news programs. They translate words to signs for deaf viewers. Although Fujimoto is a trained interpreter, that's not what she does with K-pop songs. Fujimoto considers herself a sign language artist who blends sign language and choreography in her videos. According to Fujimoto, it's about emotions. "A sign language interpreter focuses on delivering information, while a sign language artist moves people with content," explains Fujimoto.
If a hearing person watches one of Fujimoto's videos with the volume off, that person will still get a good sense of the song. Fujimoto's trendy and dynamic movements, coupled with actual Korean Sign Language (KSL) signs, bring the silent music to life. Her first video was of BTS's upbeat hit ON because of its message about not giving up, even when life is difficult. "The song was like my personal story," she says.
Fujimoto's KSL story began in high school, when she visited Korea for the first time. She fell in love with Korea, especially its pop culture. She visited again before the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and Paralympics, and was inspired by the games to learn KSL. She studied almost every day for two years to pass an extremely difficult exam, but she never gave up. When she passed the written exam, she became the first foreign person ever to do so.
Fujimoto says she will continue making videos as a sign language artist. "I believe my role is to promote deaf awareness in Korea and abroad," she says. Keep your eye on her video channel to see what she performs next!

What do BTS, GOT7, and Blackpink have in common? They are all famous K-pop bands (Korean popular music). People all over the world love K-pop. In fact, the video of BTS's song Dynamite has been watched over one billion times! Deaf people can't usually enjoy these music videos. But now, a Japanese woman named Saori Fujimoto is changing that. She makes videos that put sign language and dance together, and her videos bring the music to life. Fujimoto is a sign language artist.
You see sign language interpreters in places such as television news programs. They translate words to signs for deaf viewers. Fujimoto, however, does more than that. Using dynamic dance movements, together with Korean Sign Language (KSL) signs, Fujimoto can show the emotions in each song. Between her signs and dance movements, a deaf person can feel the song's meaning.
Fujimoto's journey to KSL began while she was in high school and went to Korea for the first time. She really fell in love with K-pop! She visited again before the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and Paralympics. After seeing KSL there, Fujimoto wanted to learn it. She started studying - but it wasn't easy. She had to study almost every day for two years. Finally, she took a very difficult written test - and became the first foreign person to pass!
In her first video, Fujimoto performed BTS's song ON. She felt it was like her own life story: don't give up, even when life is hard. Fujimoto says she will continue making videos to raise awareness about deaf people. Which K-pop song will this sign language artist perform next?

Do you know the band BTS? It's a famous K-pop - or Korean popular music - band. Millions of people around the world love K-pop. One of those people is Saori Fujimoto. Fujimoto has an interesting job. She translates the Korean language into Korean Sign Language (KSL).
Fujimoto knows deaf people can't hear K-pop. They can understand the words, not the music. Fujimoto wants to change that. She makes videos with sign language and dance together. Her videos bring the music to life for deaf people. Fujimoto is a sign language artist.
Fujimoto is from Japan. When she was in high school, she went to Korea for a visit. She fell in love with K-pop! In 2018, she visited Korea again. She saw KSL for the first time. She began learning KSL. She studied for two years. Then, she took a very hard test - and passed!
Fujimoto makes videos with things she loves - KSL and K-pop. She hopes deaf people will enjoy the words and the feelings of the music.





The Mauritshuis is an art museum in the Netherlands. It has an exhibition of old paintings. These paintings show life in the 1600s. There is something unusual about the exhibition. What is it? You look at the pictures and smell them at the same time!
There is a special machine next to some of the paintings. The machine releases a smell into the air near the painting. Some of the smells are very nice. Some of them are terrible!
One painting shows boats on the water in Amsterdam. There is a man watching the boats from a bridge. To most people, it looks very nice. But in the 1600s, the water was very dirty. It smelled awful! So the machine by the painting releases a very bad smell. Then, you understand something about life in Amsterdam in the 1600s.
The exhibition also has paintings with sweet smells, like spices and flowers. It's art you can enjoy with your eyes and your nose, too!

Smell the Art!
Arts & Entertainment
There's a new exhibition at the Mauritshuis art museum in The Hague, Netherlands. The paintings show you what life looked like in the 1600s, which isn't unusual. But at this exhibition, you'll also learn what life smelled like!
The museum's exhibition is called Smell the Art: Fleeting - Scents in Color. There are special dispensers in front of some of the artwork. Push a pedal on a dispenser, and scented air comes out. "If you smell and look at the painting at the same time, it very much enhances the experience," says Ariane van Suchtelen, the exhibition's curator.
 
The exhibition recreates real smells from the 1600s, so you experience what people felt when they first saw the paintings hundreds of years ago. For example, one picture shows an Amsterdam canal on a typical, busy day. You see small boats on the water and a man standing on a bridge. To our modern eyes, it looks very nice. But someone from the 1600s wouldn't agree. In those days, the canals were dirty and smelled terrible, so the air from the dispenser stinks!
There are sweet scents too. Enjoy the smells from a "pomander," a type of jewelry like a little ball with spices and flowers inside. In the 1600s, people believed bad smells made you sick. Rich people wore sweet-smelling pomanders to protect themselves from bad smells. The exhibition used recipes from history to recreate a pomander's scent - like the one in the painting, Portrait of Aletta Hanemans.
You mustn't touch the paintings at the exhibition. But at Scents in Color, you can enjoy the art with your eyes and your nose too!

A new exhibition at the Mauritshuis art museum in The Hague, Netherlands, has paintings by Vermeer, Rembrandt, and other Dutch masters. The paintings show you what life looked like in the 17th century, and that's not unusual. But you'll also learn what life smelled like!
The exhibit, called Smell the Art: Fleeting - Scents in Color, has special scent dispensers in front of some of the paintings. You push a pedal with your foot to release a puff of scented air. Then, some wonderful (and not so wonderful) surprises greet your nose! "If you smell and look at the painting at the same time, it very much enhances the experience," says Ariane van Suchtelen, the exhibit's curator.
 
The exhibition recreates the smells people would have experienced when the pictures were painted. For example, a Jan van der Heyden painting from around 1670 shows an Amsterdam canal on a typical, busy day. Small boats and white swans pass each other on the water while a man watches from a bridge. To our modern eyes, it is a pleasant scene. But someone from the 1670s would know: in the 17th century, the canals were used as sewers, and they smelled terrible! At the exhibition, you can experience the past by viewing the scene while smelling the scent of the canal as it used to be. According to one journalist, it smelled like "a dirty gym bag full of spoiled fish"!
The exhibition has sweet scents, too. Take your nose over to Willem van Mieris' painting, A Grocer's Shop, and breathe in the aroma of spices, such as cloves and nutmeg. Or enjoy the scent of rose and lavender from a "pomander" like the one seen in Portrait of Aletta Hanemans by Frans Hals. In the 1600s, wealthy people wore pomanders - ball-shaped jewelry with fragrant spices and flowers inside. They thought pomanders could protect them from foul scents, which they believed caused illness. The smells of the exhibition's pomanders were recreated from real historical recipes.
"We view and experience everything - not just art - with all of our senses," says van Suchtelen. Although you aren't allowed to touch the paintings, you can enjoy how the sights combine with unique smells in this delightful art exhibition.

The Unusual Sport of Zorbing
Sport
"Zorbing" is an unusual sport. When you go zorbing, you sit in a clear, plastic ball, called a "zorb". Then, you roll down a hill! Zorbs can go faster than 48 kilometers an hour!
The zorb is actually two balls. One ball is inside the other ball. You sit in the smaller ball. There is a space between the smaller ball and the larger ball. In this space there is air. This air acts like a cushion. When the ball rolls, you don't feel the ground. The air makes you bounce. It protects you.
Some riders wear a harness. The harness holds them in place as the ball rolls. Some riders don't wear a harness. When the ball rolls, they bounce all around inside the ball. Some people do "aquazorbing." There is water in the ball! And some people don't roll down a hill. They roll on a track, on flat land.
Zorbing started in New Zealand, in the 1990's. Today, you can go zorbing all over the world.
 

The Unusual Sport of Zorbing
Sport
Recently, film director Mark Vins rolled down a steep hill inside a gigantic plastic ball. Why? Vin wanted to experience the extreme sport of "zorbing."
First, a person gets inside a "zorb." A zorb is a clear inflatable ball around three meters in diameter. Next, the zorb rolls down a hill, reaching speeds of more than 48 kilometers per hour! When the zorb reaches the bottom, it slows down, and eventually stops.
The zorb is actually two balls - one inside the other. The rider sits in the smaller ball. The space between the two balls is filled with air. The air acts as a cushion to protect the rider. Riders can wear a harness that keeps them in place, or ride without a harness. Without a harness, riders can move around inside the ball. Some zorbs are big enough for just one person. Others hold up to three.
Zorbing began in the 1990's. Andrew Akers and Dwane van der Sluis developed the sport in New Zealand. It became popular quite quickly. Since then, zorbing has spread around the world. You can go zorbing in countries such as Thailand, Ireland, and Korea.
And today, there are different types of zorbing. Sometimes the zorb rolls on special metal tracks, instead of down a hill. In Florida, USA, you can watch a zorbing race on tracks. Two people, each inside their own zorb, try to be the first to reach the finish line. There's also "aqua zorbing," where the inner ball is filled with water. Riders can "swim" as they roll. It looks like they're in a washing machine! Where will this unusual sport roll to next?

The Unusual Sport of Zorbing
Sport
On a recent trip to New Zealand, film director Mark Vins did something unusual - he agreed to climb inside a giant ball and get pushed down a steep hill. While the ball sped quickly down the grassy hill, Vins was tossed around and upside down, screaming with delight. Vins was checking out the extreme sport of "zorbing."
In zorbing, a person sits inside a "zorb," a transparent inflatable plastic ball, typically around three meters in diameter. The zorb is rolled down a hill, sometimes reaching speeds of over 48 kilometers per hour! At the bottom of the hill, the zorb slows down, and stops. It's that simple.
The zorb is actually two balls - one inside the other. The rider sits in the inner ball. The space between the two balls is filled with air, which provides cushioning to protect the rider, or "zorbonaut." Zorbonauts can ride with a harness so that they stay in place, as gravity pulls the ball down the hill. Or they can ride without a harness and move freely around the zorb, like Vins. Some zorbs are big enough to hold one person, while others can hold up to three.
Zorbing was developed by New Zealanders Andrew Akers and Dwane van der Sluis in the 1990's, and it quickly took off as an extreme sport. By 2001, it was so popular that the word "zorbing" was included in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. Since the 90's, zorbing has spread around the world to countries such as Thailand, Ireland, and Korea.
There are also different types of zorbing, such as "aqua zorbing," where the inner ball is filled with water, so riders "swim" around as they roll. It's like being in a huge washing machine! For another kind of zorbing, you don't need a hill. Instead, the zorb rolls on special tracks made of metal or wood. Barriers on each side keep the zorb on the track. The company Fun Crew USA runs zorbing events in Florida, USA. In one event, two zorbonauts race each other on a track. Where will this unusual sport roll to next?




A Wild Ride

Suleiman Kangangi is a professional cyclist from Kenya, and one of the best road cyclists in the east African region, which includes Tanzania, and Uganda. But Kangangi has dreams of becoming a top cyclist at the international level too. To accomplish this, he needs to compete in international races, against people from all over the world - not just east Africa. It can be difficult, however, for Kangangi and other east African cyclists to travel to Europe, where most international road races are held. Paying for travel and accommodations is very expensive. But Kangangi and other east African cyclists are in luck. There's a new international bike race. And it provides high-level racing right on African soil! It's called the Migration Gravel Race (MGR).
The MGR is a gravel bike race. Unlike road cycling, where bikers ride on smooth pavement, gravel cyclists race off-road, traveling over rocky terrain. During the MGR, cyclists ride the rough roads of Kenya's beautiful Masai Mara National Park. In addition to cyclists from east African countries, the MGR has many of the world's top cyclists, from countries such as Italy, Switzerland, Australia, and the US.
Over four days, cyclists race through the park over a unique and challenging 650-kilometer course. Some sections of the course have gravel. Other sections have rocky, red dirt. As they ride, they can enjoy the park's stunning scenery filled with grass, trees, and rivers. Sometimes the cyclists race through rural villages. They can see wild animals, including zebras, giraffes, and monkeys. In fact, each day before racing begins, a helicopter checks the course for elephants and buffalo, making sure the course is clear for the race. After each day of racing, cyclists camp out in the park. Sometimes, they are in such remote spots they can hear hyenas crying at night.
In the most recent MGR, out of 100 cyclists, Kangangi came in fourth place. Since then, he has been invited to participate in other international gravel races. He's excited about what gravel racing and the MGR mean for future east African cyclists. "I think it will just open even more roads to the younger generation here," says Kangangi.

They eat and sleep in very remote parts of the park.
This past year's MGR had 100 riders. Kangangi came in fourth place. Since he did so well, he was invited to compete in other important, international gravel races. Kangangi is excited that the MGR is opening doors for east African cyclists.

Suleiman Kangangi is a cyclist. He is from Kenya. Kangangi wins many bike races in east Africa. But Kangangi wants to win international bike races too. For these races, Kangangi must travel to different countries. Traveling costs a lot of money, so Kangangi can't always go. But there is a new international bike race. And it's in Kenya! The race is called the Migration Gravel Race (MGR).
The MGR is a gravel bike race. The road isn't smooth. It has small rocks. It is hard to ride on rocks. In the MGR, some cyclists are from east Africa. Other cyclists are from other countries, like Italy, Switzerland, Australia, and the US. Many riders are top cyclists.
The MGR is a 650-kilometer race. It is a four-day race. Cyclists ride through Masai Mara National Park. They see elephants, zebras, giraffes, monkeys, and other wild animals. Each night, the cyclists camp outside. They sleep in tents. They eat together.
Kangangi did very well in the MGR. Because of the MGR, people invited him to more international races.





Brandon Barques likes to fish. He is an angler. To catch fish, anglers use a fishing rod. The rod has a long string, called a line. The line has a hook at the end, with food. The angler drops the line into the water and waits for a fish.
Big fish live in deep water. How do anglers get to deep water? They ride in boats. Brandon Barques doesn't use a boat. He uses a fishing drone!
A fishing drone is a flying robot with a camera. Barques connects the fishing line to the drone. Then, he flies the drone over the deep water. The drone takes a video of what it sees in the water. Barques watches this video on his cell phone. When Barques sees big fish, he makes the drone drop the line into the water. Now, Barques waits for a fish. Once, Barques caught a 54-kilogram fish!
Many anglers don't like fishing drones. They say drones are noisy. They say that fishing with drones is "cheating." But drone fishing is catching on!

Drones Go Fishing!
Sport
You probably know about the sport of fishing. An angler uses a fishing rod to drop a fishing line into the water. The end of the fishing line has a hook with bait. When a fish bites, the angler pulls the fish to shore. Anglers like to catch big fish, but most fish that live close to shore are small. To catch larger fish, anglers usually take a boat into deep water. But now there's another solution - fishing drones!
A fishing drone is a small flying vehicle with a camera. The angler attaches the end of the fishing line to the drone. Using remote control, the angler flies the drone over deep water. The drone takes a video of what it "sees" in the water below and sends the video to the angler's cell phone.
The angler watches the video. When they see fish they want to catch, they tell the drone to drop the line into the water. Now, they wait for a fish to bite. In the meantime, they fly the drone back to shore.
Angler Brandon Barques, from Hawaii, USA, had a hard time catching large fish. Then one day, using a drone, he caught a fish weighing 54 kilograms!
However, not all anglers like drone fishing. Many say that fishing with a drone is "cheating." Others complain about the noise. Drones can also hurt fish; many rare fish hide in deep water. If anglers find too many of them, these fish could disappear completely. Some countries, like the USA and South Africa, have rules about drone fishing, to protect the fish.
But like it or not, drone fishing is catching on!

Drones Go Fishing!
Sport
You probably know about the sport of fishing. An angler - someone who fishes for recreation - uses a fishing rod to drop a fishing line into the water. The end of the fishing line has a hook with bait. When a fish bites, the angler reels it in.
It isn't always easy to find big fish close to the beach, so anglers will often take a boat into deeper water. Brandon Barques has been fishing for many years. In the past, Barques searched for large fish by rowing his kayak off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. But the fish he caught weren't very big. Finally, one day, Barques caught a 54-kilogram fish! He did it with help from a fishing drone.
A fishing drone is a small flying vehicle with propellers and a camera. It's flown by an angler on shore, using remote control. To use a fishing drone, you connect the end of the fishing line from the fishing rod to the drone. The drone carries the line far over the water. As the drone flies, its camera streams video to your cell phone showing you what it "sees" in the waters below.
When you find a good area for fishing, you have the drone drop the line into the water. Now, the drone's job is done, and you return it to shore. And your job - waiting for a fish to bite and reeling it in - has just begun!
A fishing drone is helpful because it can carry your line farther out to sea than you can throw it. And with a drone, you don't need a boat.
However, not everyone approves of drone fishing. Many anglers think it's "cheating." Others say the noisy drones disturb the relaxing atmosphere. Also, fish species living in deeper water are easier to catch with drones. This could be bad for the survival of the species. Some countries, such as the USA and South Africa, have rules about drone fishing to protect the fish.
While fishing drones are mostly made to help anglers look for fish, some even carry small fish back to anglers. Perhaps future drones will be able to bring large fish back to shore. That could really change the sport!





You've probably seen lots of people riding around on bicycles. But have you ever seen someone riding a wooden bike? Wooden bikes have been popping up in cities around the world. People love the look!
Bikes made of wood aren't new. They've been around since the 1800's, but they weren't popular for long. Now, they're back in style.
Standard wooden bike frames start out as two matching pieces of wood. First, the insides of the pieces are carved out. Next, the two sides are bonded together down the middle, using strong glue. Then, the rest of the bike parts, such as the gears, wheels and handlebars - made from metal or rubber - are added.
In the past, wooden bikes were made by hand, and you can still find new handmade wooden bikes. But using modern technology, manufacturers can produce wooden bikes in larger quantities than in the past.
Many people assume that wooden bikes are less safe or durable than metal or carbon bikes. However, wooden bike creators disagree. They say wooden bikes are tested to make sure they can take a lot of pressure. They say they're just as strong as metal bikes - and that some are even stronger. Many people think wooden bikes will get damaged by water, but they're waterproofed, so you can ride them in all kinds of weather. One of the biggest advantages of wooden bikes is that the wood absorbs vibrations, so they give a smoother ride than traditional bikes.
Wooden bikes are considered a luxury item. You can buy a traditional metal bike for daily use for less than a thousand dollars. But prices at Connor Wood Bicycles start at around 3,500 dollars. However, wooden bikes need repairs less often than metal bikes, so riders save money that way.
Chris Connor, owner of Connor Wood Bicycles, is proud of the craftsmanship of his custom-made bikes. "People like having something unique, something different," he says. Jan Gunneweg and Piet Brandjes, founders of Bough Bikes, say wooden bikes combine a love of the outdoors and of natural products. "If you design from nature," they say, "you will always create something that people feel comfortable with."

Bikes made of wood aren't new. They've been around since the 1800's, but they weren't popular for long. Now, they're back in style.
In the past, wooden bikes were made by hand. It took a long time to make them. Today manufacturers can use modern technology to make wooden bikes more quickly. Most wooden bike frames start out as two pieces of wood. First, the wood is shaped into a frame. Next, the two sides are glued together down the middle. Finally, the gears, wheels, handlebars, and other bike parts are added. These parts are usually made of metal or rubber.
Some people think that wooden bikes are less safe than metal bikes. They are afraid wooden bikes aren't as strong. But wooden bike manufacturers say their bikes are stronger than metal bikes. They test the bikes to make sure they can survive a lot of wear and tear. And riding a wooden bike, you don't feel many bumps on the road.
Wooden bikes are more expensive than your typical bike. On the other hand, wooden bike makers say their bikes almost never need to be fixed. One wooden bike manufacturer, Chris Connor, says customers don't mind paying high prices for something extra-special and "different."
Wooden bikes combine a love of the outdoors and a love of natural products. As another wooden bike maker says, "If you design from nature, you will always create something that people feel comfortable with."

When you ride a wooden bike, you don't feel many bumps on the road. With other bikes, you feel more bumps. Wooden bikes cost more than other bikes. But wooden bikes don't break often. Metal bikes and wooden bikes are both strong. People who make wooden bikes test their bikes. They make sure the wood doesn't break. 
You can buy wooden bikes from special bike makers. To make a bike, they first find a nice piece of wood. Next, they cut out two pieces for the frame (the main part of the bike). Then, they put the two pieces together with glue. Next, the bike maker connects the handlebars, seat and other bike parts. Usually, these parts are metal or rubber.
Chris Connor makes wooden bicycles. He says people like his bikes because they are "extra-special and different."




What is Pickleball?
Sport
Do you like tennis or Ping-Pong? Then you may like pickleball! In these games, you hit a ball over a net. In pickleball, you hit a plastic ball. The ball is light. The ball has lots of holes. You hit the ball with a paddle. The pickleball paddle is like a Ping-Pong paddle. But the pickleball paddle is bigger.
Pickleball is easy to learn. Many sport centers have pickleball classes. You can play pickleball with two or four players. Many people like playing pickleball outside. But you can play indoors too. Some shopping malls have pickleball courts. Most pickleball players are older than 65. But young people are also starting to play.
Three friends invented pickleball. They invented the game in 1965, in Washington, USA. The friends made the game for their families to play. Then, other people started playing the sport too. Today, pickleball is very popular. People in more than 70 countries play the game. People play pickleball in Spain, India, and Japan. Maybe one day, pickleball will be in the Olympics!

What is Pickleball?
Sport
Have you ever played the sport of pickleball? Pickleball is a combination of a few different sports, including tennis and Ping-Pong (table tennis).
The sport was invented by three friends, Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. They came up with the idea one summer. They were vacationing together with their families in Washington, USA, and their children were looking for something fun to do. The men took whatever sports equipment they could find, made up some rules, and that was the start of pickleball!
To play pickleball, you need paddles, a ball, and a net. As in tennis and Ping-Pong, players hit the ball back and forth over the net. They try to keep their opponent from hitting it back.
The pickleball net is like a tennis net, but a bit shorter. The paddles are like Ping-Pong paddles, but larger. Pickleballs are hollow plastic balls with holes, about the size of a tennis balls. But they don't bounce as high. Like tennis and Ping-Pong, pickleball can be played by two or four players.
Pickleball is one of the fastest-growing sports in the USA. There are tens of thousands of pickleball courts around the country. You can play indoors or outdoors. You can even play in shopping malls! Pickleball is being taught in sport centers and retirement communities. In fact, most pickleball players are over the age of 65. But today, more and more young people are starting to play.
The sport is also being played outside the US. Seventy countries, including Spain, India, and Japan have joined the International Federation of Pickleball. Maybe one day pickleball will be in the Olympics!

Have you ever played pickleball? Many people around the world enjoy playing the sport with the funny name.
Pickleball was created in the summer of 1965, in Washington, USA, by three friends, Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. The men and their families were on vacation together. They invented the sport to keep their children busy, using whatever sports equipment they had on hand. The sport combined elements of tennis, Ping-Pong (table tennis) and badminton. The friends made the game easy to learn, and suitable for all ages and skill levels, so all family members could play.
Eventually, other people started playing pickleball too. A decade after the sport was invented, the first official pickleball tournament was held. By 1990, pickleball was being played in all 50 US states.
Pickleball is played using paddles (about twice the size of Ping-Pong paddles), a ball, and a net. As in tennis, badminton and Ping-Pong, players hit the ball over a net, trying to prevent their opponents from hitting it back. A pickleball net is somewhat shorter than a tennis net. The balls are hollow, plastic, and have holes. They are about the size of a tennis ball, but don't bounce as high.
Most pickleball games are played in "doubles," with two players on each team. But they can also be played in "singles," with two players competing against each other. Pickleball can be played on both indoor and outdoor courts. And the game can be noisy. Pickleball players and spectators often get quite loud, and they play music during games.
Pickleball is being taught in community centers, sport centers, and retirement communities around the US. In fact, most serious pickleball players are over the age of 65. "It helps you with your flexibility, your agility," says Nancy Huddleston, a retiree and pickleball enthusiast. But many young people are starting to play pickleball too. Shopping malls are even installing pickleball courts!
Today, you can find pickleball courts at about 10,000 locations in the USA. Pickleball recently made headlines as the fastest-growing sport in the country. And it's growing worldwide too. So far, 70 countries including Spain, India, and Japan, have joined the International Federation of Pickleball. Maybe one day pickleball will make it into the Olympics!





Athlete Janja Garnbret, from Slovenia, scales an indoor wall. Attached to the wall are pieces of plastic of different shapes and sizes, called "holds." Garnbret moves up the wall by grabbing onto, and stepping on, the holds. By the end of her climb, she's hanging by her fingertips almost 15 meters in the air! Garnbret is a gold medal winner in one of the newest Olympic sports: indoor rock climbing.
Since becoming an Olympic sport, many people have started indoor rock climbing. The company El Cap, which owns indoor climbing gyms in the USA, says that 10% more people started visiting its gyms at the start of the Olympics. Indoor rock climbing is also one of the fastest growing sports in the UK, according to the Association of British Climbing Walls.
Climbing gyms offer three styles of climbing - top rope, lead, and bouldering. Top rope climbers and lead climbers wear a harness around their legs and waist. In top rope, one end of the rope is tied to the top of the wall (and goes through the harness). The other end is attached to the climber's partner, who assists the climber from below.
In lead climbing, the rope isn't connected to the top of the wall. Instead, climbers keep the rope with them on their harness. They attach the rope to clips on the wall as they climb. They also have a partner to assist them.
For the last type of climbing, bouldering, a smaller wall is used. Bouldering doesn't involve ropes, harnesses, or partners. Climbers are free to use more creative, athletic movements.
In all styles of climbing, holds are arranged in unique ways to create different climbing "routes." When you climb a route, you use only the holds of one color. To help keep their feet on the holds, climbers wear special, tight shoes with sticky, rubber soles. They also wear a bag filled with powdered chalk, which they use to dry their sweaty hands.
Indoor rock climbing strengthens muscles, improves flexibility and coordination, and keeps the heart and brain healthy. Many climbers enjoy the social aspect of indoor climbing. "The climbing community is notoriously friendly, welcoming, and supportive," says long-time climber Andrew Chen.
Are you ready to join this climbing trend?

Climbing to the Top
Sport
Indoor rock climbing is a very popular sport. Around one million people go indoor rock climbing in the UK each year. Recently, indoor rock climbing became an Olympic sport. That made it even more popular around the world.
 
Rock climbing gyms have walls of different heights. Colorful plastic pieces, called "holds," stick out all over the walls. Climbers use the holds to grab onto, to pull themselves up the wall. The holds are different shapes and sizes. To help their feet stay on the holds, climbers wear special, tight shoes. They also put chalk on their hands to keep them dry, so they can grip the holds better.
Indoor climbing gyms offer three kinds of climbing � top rope, lead, and bouldering. Top rope and lead climbers wear a harness around their legs and waist. In top rope, one end of the rope is tied to the top of the wall (and goes through the harness). The other end is attached to the climber's partner, who helps the climber from below.
In lead climbing, the rope isn't connected to the top of the wall. Instead, the climber keeps the rope with them on their harness. They attach the rope to clips on the wall as they climb. They also have a partner to assist them.
The third climbing activity is bouldering. When bouldering, climbers don't use ropes and they don't need a partner. Bouldering walls aren't very high, and climbers can fall safely onto soft mats below.
Indoor rock climbing strengthens your muscles and keeps your brain healthy. It's also a good way to make new friends. Are you ready to climb?

Climbing to the Top
Sport
Many people enjoy rock climbing. It's a fun and healthy sport. But some people like to climb indoors. They go to climbing gyms.
The gyms have special walls to climb. Each wall is a different height. There are pieces of plastic all over the walls. These pieces are many colors, shapes, and sizes. Climbers call these plastic pieces "holds." Climbers put their hands and feet on the holds. They use the holds to climb up the wall. Climbers wear special climbing shoes. They put chalk on their hands too. The chalk makes it easier to grab the holds.
You can do three kinds of climbing at a climbing gym - top rope, lead, and bouldering.
Climbers who do top rope or lead work with a partner. They also use ropes and harnesses. This equipment keeps the climbers safe.
But a boulderer doesn't need equipment or a partner. Bouldering walls are low. When a boulderer falls, it is a short fall. The boulderer also falls on a soft mat.

There is a famous boat race in Ohio. People race boats made from cardboard! The name of the race is the International Cardboard Boat Regatta.
Before the race, people make boats with cardboard and tape. Then, they paint their boats. The paint makes the boats look nice. It also keeps water out of the boats.
Some people make their boats look like bees, horses, or other objects. It can take 500 hours to build boats like these! The cardboard boats are very big. People sit in their boats and hold a paddle. They use the paddle to move through the water. Some people race alone. Other people race in teams.
You can win prizes at the regatta. One prize is for the fastest boat. Another is for the best boat name. There are other prizes too.
"Team Lemon" is a group of four men. They race in the regatta every year. They also made a Cardboard Boat Museum. The museum has 30 amazing cardboard boats!

Sport
Have you ever seen a boat shaped like a teacup, a bee, or a horse?  These are actual boats! They raced in a competition. What's even more surprising? They were all made of cardboard! Each August, thousands of people come to the International Cardboard Boat Regatta, in New Richmond, Ohio, USA.
To compete in the race, you must make a boat out of cardboard, tape and house paint. The paint does more than add color; it makes the boat waterproof. The boat can be shaped and decorated in any way you want. Some boats are very complex. They take about 500 hours to build!
More than 70 people compete in the regatta each year. Some race alone. Others race in teams. Participants paddle their boats over 183 meters of the Ohio River. Winners receive trophies. Some of the trophies are for the fastest boat, the most durable boat, and the best boat name. There's even a "Titanic Award" for the boat that sinks in the most exciting way!
Tom Lemon and his team "Team Lemon" compete in the regatta every year. They used to build their boats in an old gas station. It became their workshop. One year, they found a creative cardboard boat being thrown away. They took the boat and hung it on the wall of their workshop. Soon, they added other boats. Now, their workshop is a museum - the Cardboard Boat Museum!
Today, the museum has more than 30 cardboard boats. There are canoe-shaped boats, a shoe-shaped boat, and a three-meter-long guitar boat. One boat looks like Batman's car! As Tom Lemon says, "It's just a lot of fun."

Two women paddle their bee-shaped boat quickly over the Ohio River, while the crowd cheers them on. A teacup-shaped boat starts to take on water in its saucer. And a man with a cowboy hat paddles his "horse" boat, whose tail waves in the wind. These are just a few of the cardboard boat creations that have competed in the International Cardboard Boat Regatta. This unique event takes place each August in New Richmond, Ohio - America's Cardboard Boat Racing Capital.
Each summer, thousands of people come to watch this people-powered cardboard boat race. Only boats made entirely from cardboard can compete. To build the basic structure, contestants may use only cardboard, tape and latex house paint (which, aside from adding color, makes the boats waterproof).
For the first regatta, in 1993, participants simply threw pieces of cardboard into the river, hopping on and seeing how far they could get before sinking. Over time, however, the boats became more and more sophisticated. Many of today's designs are very complex. Some can take 500 hours to build!
More than 70 participants (working individually or in teams) paddle their boats on a 183-meter river course. They compete for 27 trophies in a variety of categories, including fastest boat, most durable boat, and best boat name. And because in early races most boats sank, there's even a "Titanic Award" for the most spectacular sinking!
"Team Lemon" participates in the event every year. In 2007, this group of men started using a former gas station as their cardboard boat-building workshop. One year, they found an artistic cardboard boat headed for the trash after a race. They rescued it and displayed it on the wall of their workshop. Eventually, they added other boats to their workshop - and the world's first and only Cardboard Boat Museum was born! Today, more than 30 cardboard boats cover the walls, ceiling and floor!
The museum's collection is varied. There are canoe-shaped boats, a shoe-shaped boat, and a three-meter-long guitar boat. There's even a "Batboat," which looks like the car of comic book hero Batman.
"It's just a lot of fun," says Tom Lemon, of Team Lemon. He adds that for regatta winners there's no money in it. "It's just bragging rights for a year."





You've probably heard of the Olympic Games, but have you heard of the annual World Eskimo-Indian Olympics (WEIO)? At the WEIO, in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA, members of indigenous groups participate in a range of contests that have been part of their cultures for generations.
For centuries, indigenous villages held competitions for young men to prove they could hunt and survive in their harsh, frozen environments. Over time, residents worried that the traditional contests would be forgotten, so in 1961, they started the WEIO. Today, about 400 indigenous male and female athletes from North America, Russia, Norway, and Greenland compete in the four-day summer event.
Amber Applebee, a member of the indigenous Athabaskan group, who competes in the games, says the WEIO feels "like a big family reunion." But while WEIO contests are friendly, and competitors may offer each other advice, the athletes take competition seriously, showcasing their strength, agility and ability to deal with pain.
There are about 20 different events at the WEIO. One of the most popular contests is the "two-foot high kick." A competitor jumps into the air and kicks a ball hanging from a piece of string, with both feet. They must land with both feet on the ground, without falling. After each successful kick, the ball is raised higher. The competitor who kicks the ball at the highest height wins. Traditionally, indigenous people used kicks to communicate over long distances during whale-hunting season.
In the "Eskimo stick pull," two contestants sit face-to-face on the ground with their knees bent, holding onto a stick between them. The contestants try to pull the stick away from their opponent or pull their opponent up off the ground. This strength test requires similar skills needed to pull a seal through a hole in the ice.
In the "blanket toss," one contestant stands in the middle of a large animal-skin blanket. Dozens of people hold the edges of the blanket and throw the contestant high into the air. The contestant must remain balanced, and land on their feet!
The WEIO is both a sporting event and celebration of indigenous cultures. "I want my children to know who we are and what our people did," says Applebee, "and the WEIO is the best way to do that."

You've probably heard of the Olympics. But have you heard of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics (WEIO)? The WEIO is a four-day indigenous sporting event. Each summer, members of indigenous groups from North America, Russia, Norway, and Greenland gather in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. There, about 400 men and women compete in traditional sports and games.
Many years ago, indigenous men competed in contests to show their strength and survival skills. Indigenous people began to worry that these contests would be forgotten. So, in 1961, they started the WEIO.
One competition is the "Eskimo stick pull." To begin, two athletes sit on the ground facing each other, holding onto a stick between them. The first one to pull the stick away from their opponent wins. This contest tests strength; indigenous hunters needed strength to pull a seal through a hole in the ice.
Another competition is the "two-foot high kick." Athletes jump up and kick a ball hanging from a piece of string using both feet. They must land with both feet on the ground. Each time they succeed, the ball is raised higher. Whoever kicks the ball at the highest height wins.
In the "blanket toss" one contestant stands in the middle of a large animal-skin blanket. Many people hold onto the blanket and throw the contestant high into the air. The contestant must stay upright, on their feet.
The WEIO is a sporting event and celebration of cultures. Athlete Amber Applebee is a member of the indigenous Athabaskan group. "I want my children to know who we are and what our people did," she says. "The WEIO is the best way to do that."

Did you enjoy jump roping as a child? Many people used to think jump roping was just for kids. But the pandemic changed that. Millions of people stayed home during lockdowns, and gyms everywhere closed. It was the perfect time for adults to try the sport of jump roping.
Jump roping became a competitive sport in the 20th century, but there are lots of reasons it became so popular during the pandemic. First, you can do it alone. And it doesn't need very much space, so it's a great activity to do indoors. Also, you don't need any expensive equipment. A basic jump rope costs less than $20. Finally, jump ropes are portable. You can take your rope with you and exercise anywhere you want.
Lauren Flymen, from Saint Albans, England, began jumping after watching jump rope videos on social media at the start of the pandemic. She improved her jumping, and even learned to do tricks. Flymen began posting her own videos, and today, she has more than 300,000 followers! "People think jump roping looks easy but it's not," says Flymen.
Jump roping - like most sports - is good for your health too. A 2013 study found that 10 minutes of jump roping is as good for you as 30 minutes of running. Additionally, research shows jump roping makes your heart stronger. It also lowers your blood pressure, and it improves coordination and balance. Flymen believes one of the biggest benefits has been for her mental health. "You actually don't think about all your troubles and all your stresses in life," says Flymen.

Walk past any schoolyard and you'll probably see kids playing jump rope. Children love doing this fun activity alone, in pairs, or in groups. You may think jump roping is just for kids, but the pandemic changed that. As gyms closed worldwide and lockdowns kept millions of people at home, many adults found jump roping to be the perfect sport.
There are lots of reasons jump roping (or as the British call it, skipping) became so popular during the pandemic. You can do it alone, it doesn't require too much skill to get started, and you don't have to buy a lot of expensive equipment. A basic jump rope costs less than $20. Also, jump roping requires very little space, so it's a great activity for those stuck indoors. And it's portable, so you can exercise anywhere.
Just ask Lauren Flymen of Saint Albans, England. At the beginning of the pandemic, Flymen was inspired by "jumpers" on social media. As she improved, Flymen learned tricks like the "mic release" where she lets the handle go, whips the rope around, and then catches it again - all while jumping! Flymen began posting her own videos, and she now has more than 300,000 followers!
Jump roping has been a competitive sport since the 20th century. Today, more than 60 countries are members of the International Jump Rope Union. The organization holds competitions where athletes do more than just jumping. There are freestyle events - where jumpers do amazing tricks with exotic names, such as the two-footed frog, full twist, cougar, and triple under. "People think jump roping looks easy, but it's not," says Flymen.
Besides tricks, there are other reasons to jump rope. It's good for you! According to a 2013 study from Arizona State University, 10 minutes of jump roping is as good for you as 30 minutes of running. Additionally, research shows it lowers your blood pressure and strengthens your heart. Jumpers also improve their coordination and balance. Flymen believes one of the biggest benefits has been for her mental health. "You actually don't think about all your troubles and all your stresses in life," says Flymen. Some jumpers even say it's like meditation!

The Exciting World of Teqball
Sport
It's the last moments of the match between Brazil and Hungary - and the clock is ticking. Brazil's coach looks worried. Can his team hold onto their lead? With only a few seconds left, player Natalia Guitler sends the ball flying with a powerful kick and... Brazil wins! The crowd is on its feet! Is this the end of a thrilling championship soccer match? No! It's... teqball.
Invented in 2012, the fast-paced sport of teqball combines elements of table tennis, soccer, and volleyball. The teqball table looks like a table tennis table, but the surface is curved and it's divided by a clear piece of plexiglass - not a net. Also, like table tennis, the exciting sport is played between two players as a singles game, or between four players as a doubles game. Teqball uses an actual soccer ball, and teqball players - called teqers - can use any part of their body to hit the ball, except their hands and arms. Just like volleyball, players get three hits before sending the ball back to their opponents.
One unique feature of teqball is that technique is more important than strength. That means women can compete as equals with men. In fact, according to the official rules of the game, teqball is played by two or four players, regardless of gender. In teqball, men and women often compete against each other and play on mixed gender teams. According to teqer Carolyn Greco, "Teqball isn't a contact sport, and being smaller or less strong than some of the men I play against is not as much of a factor."
Despite this, Greco and Nancy Avesyan started the world's first all-female teqball club called Bella Teq in California, USA. Greco and Avesyan hope their club will encourage more women to become teqball athletes, because at present, the sport is dominated by male players.
To date, there are teqball clubs in almost 100 countries around the world, and the sport is growing fast. Teqball has been recognized by the National Olympic Committees of Africa and Asia. "Our North Star right now is to be an Olympic sport by 2028," said Ajay Nwosu, president of the USA National Teqball Federation.

It's the last minute of an exciting match between Brazil and Hungary, and Brazil is leading. With only a few seconds left, a Brazilian player gives the ball a powerful kick and... Brazil wins! The crowd cheers! Is this the end of a championship soccer game? No! It's... teqball.
Teqball is a bit like table tennis, soccer, and volleyball. Players - called teqers - play on two sides of a table. The table, however, is curved and has a piece of clear plastic across it, not a net. Also, like table tennis, teqball is played between two players, or between four players. Both soccer and teqball use a soccer ball, and players can use any part of their body to hit the ball, except their hands and arms. And like volleyball, players get three hits before sending the ball back to their opponents.
In teqball, how you play is more important than how strong you are. According to teqer Carolyn Greco, "Being smaller or less strong than some of the men I play against is not as much of a factor." In fact, teqball rules allow men and women to compete against each other. They also allow mixed-gender teams. Although today most teqball players are men, Greco wants to change that. She and another teqer called Nancy Avesyan started Bella Teq, the world's first all-female teqball club. Greco hopes the club, which is in California, USA, will encourage more women to join the sport.
Teqball was invented in 2012, and this exciting, young sport already has clubs in almost 100 countries. What's next for teqball? Players hope it will become an Olympic sport by 2028!

Imagine a game with two players. There is a table between them. The players hit a ball across the table. Can you guess the sport? Here's a hint... No! It isn't table tennis.

The sport is teqball. It's a fast, exciting game. You can play teqball with teams of one or two players. A team can have men, or women, or both! According to the rules, it doesn't matter.
Today, most teqball players are men. But Carolyn Greco from California, USA, wants more women to play. That's why she started a teqball club only for women. It's called Bella Teq.
Teqball began in 2012. Today, the sport is very popular. There are teqball clubs in more than 100 countries! Teqball players are very excited about the new sport. They hope it will be in the Olympics in 2028.
 





It's summer, and Nawina Mufaya is swimming. But Mufaya is in Scotland. And summers in Scotland are cold. But Mufaya doesn't mind. She swims in an outdoor swimming pool in the cold weather. And she's not alone. Mufaya belongs to a club. It's an outdoor swimming club. Mufaya swims with other people in the club.
There are many outdoor swimming clubs. Some clubs don't swim in pools. They swim in lakes, rivers and oceans. Swimming in nature is called "wild swimming."
Scientists say that outdoor swimming helps people sleep better. The cold water keeps their skin healthy. The cold water also keeps their minds healthy.
The Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) is a special group. Their swimmers go on swimming adventures. They may go to the beautiful Blue Lagoon in Malta. They may swim down a river in Iceland. They may swim with seals in Devon, UK!
But outdoor swimming isn't new. The Brighton Swimming Club is an outdoor swimming club. And it is 160 years old!

It's typical summer weather in Greenock, Scotland - cloudy, windy, and cold (about 12� C ) - not what you'd normally call "swimming weather." Yet, a group of people are swimming in an outdoor pool. They're part of an outdoor swimming club called the Inverclyde Masters. "The only thing that would stop us swimming in the outdoor pool would be lightning," says club member Nawina Mufaya. The outdoor pool is a heated saltwater pool, open from May through September.
But for some outdoor swimmers, swimming in a pool isn't enough. They prefer "wild swimming" - swimming in natural bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes and oceans. Some wild swimmers want the challenge of swimming in colder, rougher water. Others just enjoy swimming in nature. 
The Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) was founded in 2006. It educates people about wild swimming. OSS members go on swimming adventures in beautiful places around the world. Some swim over sparkling white sand in Malta's Blue Lagoon. Others swim down freezing rivers in Iceland. One group, swimming off the coast of Devon, UK, were joined by local seals!
Outdoor swimming isn't some new trend. The UK has many swimming clubs. The oldest, Brighton Swimming Club, is 160 years old. Club member Adam Sage starts each day with a dip in the Atlantic Ocean. Member David Bailey commutes to work by swimming there!
Researchers say that outdoor swimming helps people sleep better. And the cold water keeps their skin healthy, Dr. Mark Harper is researching how outdoor swimming affects people with depression. He believes the cold water improves their mental health.
Today, more and more people are "diving" into the outdoor swimming experience!

"The only thing that would stop us swimming in the outdoor pool would be lightning," says Nawina Mufaya, a member of the club. Club members swim outside from May through September. Then, the outdoor pool closes.
For other outdoor swimmers, swimming in a pool is not enough. They swim in natural bodies of water, like lakes, rivers, and oceans. This is called "wild swimming." Wild swimmers may be drawn to the sport by their love of nature. Others seek the challenge of rougher conditions from waves and cold, choppy water.
Kate Rew founded the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS). Its goal is to educate people about swimming outside. Since 2006, the society has grown from 300 members to 100,000. The OSS also has a free, online crowdsourced swim map, showing wild swimming spots worldwide. Members of the OSS have had swimming adventures in beautiful places, such as the pristine waters of Malta's Blue Lagoon, or a nearly frozen river in Iceland. Sea swimmers in Devon, UK, were joined by local seals!
Outdoor swimming isn't some new trend. The Brighton Swimming Club (BSC), a UK swimming club that does outdoor swimming, is 160 years old. The BSC has enthusiastic members, such as Adam Sage, who starts each day with a dip in the Atlantic Ocean, and David Bailey, who "swimmutes" (commutes by swimming) two kilometers to his law office.
Experts say that outdoor swimming's health benefits include better sleep, and healthier skin from being in cold water. Dr. Mark Harper, from Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, is researching how swimming in cold water helps people with depression. Harper is optimistic about the results so far, saying open air swimming has "all the benefits of an effective treatment for mental health."
Whether it's "open air" swimming or "wild" swimming, more and more people across the globe are "diving" into this form of exercise!





Have you ever been to a trampoline park? These indoor spaces have wall-to-wall trampolines and other equipment. Today, with more than 1,500 trampoline parks across the globe, chances are you, or someone you know, have enjoyed jumping at one of these parks. But how did trampolines become so popular? Believe it or not, it all started at the circus!
George Nissen was an accomplished diver and gymnast from Iowa, USA, who tried unsuccessfully to get on the 1932 Olympic diving team. At 16, while he was watching high-wire acrobats at the circus, Nissen had a great idea. At the end of their act, the acrobats jumped down from the high wire, bouncing onto a safety net below. Nissen thought the acrobats could turn the bouncing into tumbling. He began working on a "tumbling device." Nissen tried using materials such as old tires, wood, and different types of metal for his device. Eventually, he used a large piece of strong cloth called "canvas" that was pulled tightly over a metal frame. The frame was in the shape of a rectangle, and the device folded up for easy transport. The trampoline was born!
The 1940s were an important time for the trampoline. Nissen co-founded the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline and Tumbling Company in 1942 to sell his invention. He also applied for a patent, which he received in 1945. During World War II, Nissen sold around 100 trampolines to the US military. Pilots would practice jumping very high, then spinning in the air. This helped them learn how to control their bodies, and orient themselves while flying. In later years, trampolines were used to train astronauts. As the training developed, Nissen created a game called Spaceball which was played on trampoline "courts."
As trampolines continued to be part of popular culture, they showed up all over the USA. They were so popular in the 1950s, that gas stations used them to attract customers. The 1960s brought the first trampoline parks. And Nissen's design has continued to evolve as new types, such as trampolines that float on water, have been developed.
In 2000, trampoline became an Olympic event. "That was always my goal and my dream," said Nissen. "The struggle and the journey - that's the Olympic spirit."

A trampoline park is a large, indoor space filled with trampolines. Today there are more than 1,500 trampoline parks all over the world. How did trampolines become popular? Well, it all started when a gymnast named George Nissen went to the circus!
As a young gymnast in Iowa, USA, Nissen enjoyed watching acrobats perform at the circus. At the end of the show, they would jump down onto a net. When he saw them bouncing on the net, Nissen was inspired. He thought there could be a way to turn bouncing into tumbling. So Nissen started making a "tumbling device" for gymnasts. At first, he tried using old tires and wood. Finally, he built a metal frame in the shape of a rectangle. A large piece of strong cloth called "canvas" was pulled tightly over the frame. The trampoline was born!
In 1942, Nissen started a company to sell his new trampolines. People were very excited about them. The US military bought around 100 trampolines to teach pilots about finding the right direction inside their airplanes. Later, trampolines were used to train astronauts for space travel. But trampolines also became popular with people who just wanted to have fun. By the 1960s, the first trampoline parks were built. And people made new kinds of trampolines, too. There is even a trampoline that floats on water!
In the year 2000, trampoline became an Olympic event for the first time. "That was always my goal and my dream," he said "The struggle and the journey - that's the Olympic spirit."

In the 1930s, George Nissen was a gymnast in Iowa, USA. One day, he went to the circus. He saw people "flying" high in the air. Then, they jumped down onto a net. They bounced up and down on the net. That gave Nissen an idea. He started to make an invention. People could jump and bounce on his invention. He called it a "trampoline."
In 1942, Nissen started a company to make trampolines. The US military bought 100 trampolines from Nissen. They used the trampolines to teach pilots about flying. Pilots jumped on a trampoline. It felt like flying in an airplane. Later, astronauts used trampolines too.
Trampolines weren't just for pilots and astronauts. People used trampolines to have fun. Trampolines became very popular. In the 1960s, people built the first trampoline parks. Today, there are more than 1,500 trampoline parks all over the world. Is there a trampoline park near you? Then go for a jump. It's a lot of fun!




Baseball or Pes�pallo?
Sport
You're watching a ball game. The batter hits the ball with a bat. The batter runs to the bases. People stand up and cheer. Is this a baseball game? No. It's a pes�pallo game! Pes�pallo is Finland's national sport.
Lauri "Tahko" Pihkala invented pes�pallo in 1922. Pihkala was from Finland. He wanted Finland to have its own game. Pihkala liked American baseball. So he made pes�pallo like baseball in some ways.
How are baseball and pes�pallo alike? In both games, two teams play against each other. Each team has nine players. The field has four bases. "Batters" hit a ball and run to the bases. "Fielders" try to get the batters "out."
But pes�pallo is also different from baseball. A pes�pallo field is long and narrow. Pes�pallo pitchers stand very close to the batter. Then, they throw the ball straight up. In pes�pallo, players run to the bases in a zigzag path. Pes�pallo is a faster game than baseball.
Today, people in India, Germany and Australia also play pes�pallo. They like this exciting game.

The batter swings the bat. The bat hits the ball up toward the sky. The batter runs to the bases and scores. The crowd stands up, clapping and shouting. Are they at a baseball game? No. They're at a pes�pallo game! Pes�pallo is Finland's national sport. It was inspired by American baseball.
Lauri "Tahko" Pihkala invented pes�pallo in 1922. As an athlete and coach in Finland, Pihkala knew that sports help people stay healthy. After Finland won its independence in 1917, Pihkala thought a new sport would be good for the country. Pihkala was inspired by an American baseball game he saw in 1907, so he began developing his own ball game.
Like American baseball, pes�pallo has two teams of nine players. The playing field has four bases. "Batters" hit the ball with a bat, then run to the bases to try and score "runs" (points). There are also "fielders," who try to get the ball, and get the batter "out".
But pes�pallo and baseball are also very different. For example, a baseball field has a diamond shape. A pes�pallo field has a long, narrow shape. A baseball pitcher throws the ball from the center of the field. In Pes�pallo, the pitcher stands right in front of the batter and throws the ball straight up over the batter's head. In baseball, players run counterclockwise around the field. In pes�pallo, players run in a zigzag pattern. Pes�pallo is a quicker game than baseball, and many people find it more exciting.
Pes�pallo is spreading around the world. Pes�pallo games are being played in India, Germany and Australia. Score one for pes�pallo!

The batter swings the bat. The bat connects with the ball, sending it flying high. The batter runs to the bases and scores. The crowd goes wild. They stand up and cheer. Are the fans at a baseball game? No. They're at a pes�pallo game! Pes�pallo is a ball game that's almost 100 years old. It's also the national sport of Finland.
Pes�pallo was invented in 1922 by Lauri "Tahko" Pihkala. Pihkala was an Olympic athlete, coach, and physical education instructor in Finland. After World War I, Finland became an independent country. Pihkala thought that sports would help his young country develop a national identity, while also promoting healthy living. Pihkala visited the USA several times, and became interested in American baseball on a trip in 1907. Back in Finland, Pihkala began developing his own version of baseball, with modified rules and elements of the Finnish game "king ball." Pes�pallo became popular in schools and in the military.
Like in American baseball, pes�pallo has two teams of nine players. The teams compete on a field with four bases. There are "batters," who hit balls with a bat, and then touch the bases in order to score "runs" (points). There are "fielders" in the playing field, who try to get the ball, and get the batter "out."
One feature that makes pes�pallo different from American baseball is the field it's played on. Instead of baseball's well-known diamond shape, a pes�pallo field is narrower and longer. Another difference is that the pitcher doesn't throw the ball to the batter from a pitcher's mound in the center of the field, like in baseball. Instead, the pes�pallo pitcher stands in front of the batter, and throws the ball straight up, at least one meter above the batter's head. And finally, in pes�pallo, runners run to the bases in a zigzag pattern, instead of counterclockwise. All these factors help to make pes�pallo a faster-paced game than baseball, with players running about 10 kilometers per game.
Today, pes�pallo is spreading around the world. Pes�pallo games are being played in India, Germany and Australia. Homerun for pes�pallo!




The World's Longest Horse Race
Sport
In many horse races, riders race horses around a track. But in Mongolia, there is a very different kind of horse race. In this race, riders try to complete a 1,000-kilometer route across Mongolia. This unusual horse race, called the Mongol Derby, is considered to be the longest and toughest horse race on Earth.
Each August, Mongol Derby participants attempt to finish the course in less than 10 days, riding up to 14 hours per day. They travel a route based on a mail delivery system created by Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan in the year 1224. Riders from all over the world, and of all different skill levels, compete. They pay around $15,000 to participate. A few days before the race begins, riders take part in a three-day training session.
During the race, competitors ride Mongolian horses (around three million roam the country). Every 40 kilometers, riders stop at a station to switch to new horses and let the other horses rest. Veterinarians monitor the horses' health at each station. Riders wear GPS trackers. This is to locate riders in case of emergency and so that fans can follow their progress online.
The Mongolian grasslands are a difficult terrain. Competitors ride over hills, through valleys and across rivers. They ride in high winds and extreme temperatures�from -40�C to 30�C. At each of the 25 stations along the route, local Mongolian families make sure competitors (and horses) have food and a place to sleep. This gives riders an opportunity to meet the local population and learn about their culture.
The Mongol Derby has strict rules about how much weight the horses can carry. Riders can only weigh 85 kilograms; and that's with riding gear, including the horse's saddle. They may only bring five kilograms of extra supplies, such as soap, a toothbrush, and a sleeping bag. Many riders bring medical supplies in case they get hurt. And many riders do get hurt; it's a very dangerous race. Fewer than half the riders finish. Yet more and more people sign up each year.
"I came here to push myself, to challenge myself," said one participant. "I've learned a lot about Mongolian culture. I've learned a lot about the horses. Most importantly, I've learned a lot about myself."

The World's Longest Horse Race

In Mongolia there is a special horse race. It's the longest and hardest horse race on Earth. It's the Mongol Derby.
In the Mongol Derby, riders have less than 10 days to race 1,000 kilometers across Mongolia. People from all over the world pay around $15,000 to compete. The course is based on a route Genghis Khan created to deliver mail in the year 1224. In 1224, messengers on horseback rode along the route delivering mail.
The Mongol Derby course is very difficult. It has hills and rivers. The weather makes it hard, too. Strong winds blow. Temperatures can reach 30�C and drop below -40�C. During the race, riders wear GPS trackers so people can find them in case of emergency.
Every 40 kilometers, riders stop at a horse station to get a new horse. This gives the horses a chance rest and get checked by veterinarians. At each of the race's 25 stations, local Mongolian families make sure riders have food and a place to sleep. This is an opportunity for riders to meet people from the area and experience Mongolian culture.
In addition to their riding gear, riders can carry five kilograms of extra supplies, such as soap, a toothbrush, and a sleeping bag. Many riders bring medical supplies in case they get hurt. And many do get hurt. Fewer than half actually finish the race. But that doesn't keep people from racing.
"I came here to push myself," said one rider. "I've learned a lot about Mongolian culture. I've learned a lot about the horses. Most importantly, I've learned a lot about myself."

In the 1977 movie Star Wars, people had weapons called "lightsabers". These were special swords, with lights. Some people liked the movie so much, they made their own lightsabers. Fighting with these lightsabers became very popular. Today, it is a real sport called lightsaber dueling.
Like all sports, lightsaber dueling has rules. First, fighters must wear special clothing. This is because the fighters hit each other with their lightsabers. (Don't worry - lightsabers aren't sharp!) When fighters hit another fighter with their lightsaber, they get points. The winner is the first fighter to get 15 points in three minutes. Some people say lightsaber dueling is just like the movie. The lightsabers look and sound like the ones in Star Wars. Also, the room stays dark during the fights. This makes it easy to see the lightsabers moving around.
Lightsaber dueling is popular all over the world. Maybe one day it will be an Olympic sport.

Lightsaber Dueling
Sport
Did you fight with toy lightsabers as a child? Lightsabers look like long, glowing sticks. The weapons, which thrilled movie audiences, were seen in the first Star Wars movie in 1977. Recently, movie magic and reality came together. The French Fencing Federation (FFF) officially accepted lightsaber dueling as a competitive sport.
In the movie, lightsabers were sharp enough to cut a person in half. But competition lightsabers aren't dangerous. Fighters hold a metal handle connected to a long cylinder of hard plastic. Many competition lightsabers even have sound effects, so they sound like the weapons in the movie. During a competition, fighters move the lightsaber in almost the same way as a traditional fencing weapon.
The FFF is France's official organization for the sport of fencing. It created rules for lightsaber competitions. Fighters wear protective masks and clothing. Inside a circle marked on the floor, they try to score points by hitting each other with their lightsabers. Each fight lasts three minutes. The winner is the first fighter to earn 15 points or is ahead at the end of the fight. Competitions take place in a dark room, making the lightsabers exciting to watch.
The FFF hopes that young people will become interested in the sport. The FFF's secretary general, Serge Aubailly, is worried about the lack of exercise in young people's lives. He believes mixing sport and modern technologies is one way to make participating feel "natural" for young fighters.
Fencing has been an Olympic sport since 1896. Could future Olympic Games include a lightsaber dueling event?

Did you fight with toy lightsabers as a child? Lightsabers are sword-like, fictional weapons that were introduced in the first Star Wars movie in 1977. Audiences were fascinated as they watched knights battling each other with glowing, futuristic lightsabers. But that was only make-believe...  or was it? Recently, fiction met reality when the French Fencing Federation (FFF) officially recognized lightsaber dueling as a competitive sport.
Though the FFF's announcement may be surprising to some, Charley Cummings, who co-founded the lightsaber dueling league, Saber Legion, has seen rapid, international growth since starting the league in 2015. "We're offering a sport to people who are not necessarily into football or baseball or soccer," Cummings says.
In the Star Wars movies, lightsabers had powerful lasers that could cut a person in half. Competition lightsabers, which use a long cylinder of hard plastic that lights up, aren't as dangerous. But many of them come with a computer chip that makes sound effects, giving them an authentic feel. During combat, a fighter holds onto the metal hilt and moves the lightsaber almost the same way as a traditional fencing saber.
As the official organization for the sport of fencing in France, the FFF created rules for lightsaber competitions. Fighters wear protective masks and body armor. They fight inside a circle marked on the floor and score points for hitting their opponents with their lightsaber. A fight lasts three minutes. The winner is the first fighter to earn 15 points or is ahead when the time is over. A darkened arena enhances the sport's visual appeal.
The FFF hopes their rules and acceptance of the sport will attract fighters from the younger generation. Young people "...don't do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs," says Serge Aubailly, the FFF's secretary general. He feels that this has become a public health issue and notes, "That is why we are trying to create a bond between our discipline and modern technologies, so participating in a sport feels natural." 
Fencing has been part of the Olympic Games since 1896. Could lightsaber dueling become the next great Olympic event?





For people with stress, anxiety, and depression, there are a variety of treatments. But the Brugmann University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, is offering an additional, unusual treatment. It is a "prescription" for free museum visits!
The hospital is using "museum prescriptions" along with other treatments for patients with mental health issues. Doctors at the Brugmann University Hospital worked with Delphine Houba, Brussel's deputy mayor in charge of culture, to create the program. For now, this is a trial program for six months. During the trial, patients can visit five museums or cultural spots in Brussels for free. They can also bring friends or family members.
Studies show a connection between museums - especially art museums - and mental health. "Art museums have great potential to positively impact people," says researcher Katherine Cotter of the University of Pennsylvania, "including reducing their stress..." Similarly, H�l�ne Boyer, Vice President of the of the Canadian medical association M�decins Francophones du Canada, says that spending time enjoying art can increase levels of serotonin in the body. Serotonin is a chemical that helps us feel good. A 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) report also stated that interacting with art can benefit people with mental health issues.
At the five participating Brussels institutions, patients can see fashion and art, learn about the history of Brussels, and even visit the city's sewers! One institution is the Fashion and Lace Museum, where visitors can look at clothing, lace and accessories dating from the 16th century to the present day. Another is Brussels City Museum, which has paintings, artifacts, and photographs showing Brussels through the ages.
In the trial program, patients discuss their museum experience with their doctors before and after each visit. Doctors hear what the patients liked or didn't like about the visit. Then, they analyze the results to find out if the visits were helpful. If the museum prescription program is successful, it will be open to more cultural institutions and more patients. There have been programs like this in other places such as Montreal, Canada. But Houba believes it's the first of its kind in Europe.
So, if you're coping with stress and anxiety, a trip to the museum might be just what the doctor ordered!

Museums as Medicine?
Health
It's not unusual to get a prescription for medicine from a doctor. But have you ever received a prescription for a free museum visit? That's exactly what doctors at a hospital in Brussels, Belgium, are prescribing to patients who are dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression.
In a new program at Brugmann University Hospital, patients with stress or anxiety are being given (along with other treatments) free admission to five different museums in Brussels. Family members or friends can go too. The World Health Organization (WHO) looked at thousands of studies on culture and health. In 2019, WHO reported that interacting with art is good for our physical and mental health.
Doctors speak with patients before and after each visit. That way, doctors can find out if the visits are helpful. The hospital is trying the program for six months. If it is successful, more museums will be encouraged to participate.
One museum patients can visit with their prescription is the Fashion and Lace Museum. It has clothing, lace, and accessories from the 16th century. They can also visit the Brussels City Museum, which has objects, paintings, and photographs showing the history of Brussels.
For the doctors at Brugmann University Hospital, the museum prescriptions are an important part of a treatment plan for patients with mental health issues. Delphine Houba, Brussel's deputy mayor in charge of culture, says it's the first program of its kind in Europe. Houba worked with the doctors to create the program and feels very proud of it.
For people with anxiety or depression, a trip to the museum may be just what the doctor ordered!

Museums as Medicine?
Health
When people feel sick, they often go to a doctor. And the doctor often gives them a prescription for medicine. But now, doctors in a hospital in Brussels are giving some patients another, unusual kind of prescription. This prescription is for a trip to a museum!
Brugmann University Hospital has a program for people who have anxiety. The patients get their regular treatment, but they also get to visit museums for free. They can also bring a friend or someone in their family. Doctors think that looking at art will help the patients feel better. As they enjoy the art, they will have less anxiety.
One museum that patients can visit is the Brussels City Museum. There, patients can learn about the history of Brussels. At Centrale, patients can see modern art. Patients can also visit the Fashion and Lace Museum. It has very old clothing and accessories.
Right now, there are five museums patients can visit. But hopefully, more will join soon. Because pills can be medicine. But art can be medicine too!




Let Telemedicine Help!
Health
Today, many people are staying home because of COVID-19. But some people feel ill. They want to see a doctor. But they don't want to go to a hospital or doctor's office. They're afraid to get COVID-19. What can they do? They can use "telemedicine." With telemedicine, they don't have to go out. Doctors use technology to treat patients at home.
There are three kinds of telemedicine. One is "store and forward." An example is when a doctor needs advice from an expert. The doctor sends a patient's tests to the expert over the computer. The expert looks at the tests and gives the doctor advice.
Another kind of telemedicine is "live interaction." A doctor sees patients over the computer. They do video chats. Sometimes they speak on the phone.
The third kind of telemedicine is "remote monitoring." Patients have a special device at home. It checks their health. It might check their weight or blood sugar. Then, it sends this information to doctors' smartphones.
Telemedicine isn't new. But COVID-19, is making telemedicine very popular.

Let Telemedicine Help!
Health
Today, hospitals are filled with people who have the COVID-19 virus. But what about people with other illnesses? They need help, too. But many don't want to go to the hospital or doctor's office. They're afraid they'll catch the virus. Doctors treat these patients using "telemedicine." Telemedicine uses technology to treat patients at home.
There are different kinds of telemedicine. Doctors may use just one type, or a mixture of different kinds. One kind of telemedicine is "live interaction." Doctors speak with patients over video chat, or even just over the phone.
Sometimes a doctor needs advice from a specialist. If they're in different places, they can use a kind of telemedicine called "store and forward." The doctor sends x-rays or other tests electronically to the specialist, and gets his or her advice.
"Remote monitoring" telemedicine helps patients who live far away from hospitals. Nurses visit these patients at home. The nurse checks the person's weight and gives them blood tests. Then, the nurse sends the information to a doctor. There are also devices that patients can use to check themselves. An app sends the information directly to doctors' smartphones.
Today, because of COVID-19, more patients are interested in using telemedicine than ever before. According to General Brigham, a healthcare company in Boston, USA, before the COVID crisis, around 1,600 patients a month used telemedicine. During the crisis, the number jumped up to 242,000!
No one knows what will happen when the crisis is over. Doctors will always need to see some patients face-to-face. But now, more people might appreciate the convenience of telemedicine. Many experts believe that telemedicine is here to stay.

Let Telemedicine Help!
Health
Staff in hospitals across the globe are working tirelessly, caring for patients infected with COVID-19. To reduce the spread of the virus, countries have been asking their citizens to stay home as much as possible, and only go out in cases of emergency. But how can patients with other illnesses, who have gone to hospitals or doctors' offices before the pandemic, receive care? One answer is "telemedicine." Telemedicine uses electronic communications (such as e-mail and video chat) along with software, to treat patients remotely. Telemedicine allows doctors to interact with patients without seeing them in person.
There are three common types of telemedicine. "Live interaction" telemedicine allows patients and doctors to speak in real time using the telephone or video conferencing. Another type is "store and forward," in which doctors can share x-rays and test results with specialists at another location. This enables doctors to consult with each other no matter where they are - even if they're in different countries.
With a third type of telemedicine, "remote monitoring," patients (or nurses who visit patients' homes) check their blood pressure, blood sugar levels, or weight, at home. Then, they send the information to a doctor. There are also self-monitoring devices, such as personal EKG machines, with an app that sends results directly to doctors' smartphones. Remote monitoring helps people who live in rural settings, far from doctors and hospitals. It also helps people who are elderly and those with chronic diseases. Doctors might choose to use just one type of telemedicine, or a combination of them.
Many people hadn't even heard of telemedicine before the COVID-19 crisis, but stay-at-home orders have made telemedicine more popular than ever. About a month before the COVID-19 crisis in the USA, the healthcare company, General Brigham, in Boston, treated 1,600 patients via video visits. Then, as the crisis took hold, the number of video visits went up to 242,000!
No one knows what healthcare will be like after the pandemic. And there will still be patients who need to see doctors in person. But as more people learn about telemedicine, and see its effectiveness and efficiency, there's a good chance they'll continue to use it. According to many experts, telemedicine is going to transform healthcare... permanently.





Do you start your day with a cup of coffee? Although we don't know exactly when people first began drinking coffee, we do know that millions of people around the world start their day with it. But lately, in a world that has become more and more aware of the benefits of a healthy diet, people worry about their coffee. It seems like every week there's a new study about coffee - and each new study often disagrees with the one before. Research has shown both health risks and benefits of coffee. Maybe that's why many people keep looking for healthier ways to get their daily fix. One new coffee trend has an unexpected and completely natural ingredient - mushrooms!
There are more than 10,000 different types of mushrooms in the world. One variety, which people have used in drinks for centuries, is called chaga. Chaga tea, for example, is a popular drink in Finland, where people drink it to relax. The black chaga mushrooms grow on trees, have important nutrients such as vitamin D, and may help protect against brain illnesses such as Alzheimer's. Chaga, which also helps strengthen the immune system, is a common ingredient in mushroom coffee.
While growing up on a farm in Finland, Tero Isokauppila picked mushrooms regularly. "A lot of people have a very strong opinion of mushrooms; they either love them or hate them," says Isokauppila, who believes in the medicinal properties of mushrooms. In 2012, Isokauppila founded a company called Four Sigmatic, selling coffee with chaga and other types of mushrooms. To make the coffee, mushrooms are picked, dried and made into a powder. Then, the powder is mixed with instant coffee. One health benefit is that instant mushroom coffee contains half the caffeine of a normal cup of coffee.
So, how does mushroom coffee taste? Dietician Ayla Gentiletti tried it and thought it was bitter, saying, "I've heard it tastes much better with coffee creamer and sweetener!" But others say it tastes just like regular coffee, and recommend it for people who want to make their coffee habit healthier. Though Gentiletti says more research needs to be done on mushroom coffee's health claims, it looks like the mushroom coffee trend will continue. Maybe mushroom milk and sugar will be next!

Millions of people around the world love coffee. But some worry about their favorite drink. Is it healthy? Researchers say there are both risks and benefits to coffee. That's why people are always looking for healthier coffee - for example, mushroom coffee!
There are more than 10,000 different kinds of mushrooms in the world. One kind is called chaga. People have used chaga in drinks for centuries. In Finland, people drink tea with chaga mushrooms to relax. Chaga is used in many mushroom coffees too. The black chaga mushrooms grow on trees. They have important nutrients such as vitamin D. Chaga may also help keep our brains healthy.
Tero Isokauppila, who grew up in Finland, started a company called Four Sigmatic in 2012. The company sells coffee with chaga and other types of mushrooms. Isokauppila believes that mushrooms have the power to heal. But not everyone likes the idea of mushrooms. "A lot of people have a very strong opinion of mushrooms; they either love them or hate them," says Isokauppila.
To make mushroom coffee, mushrooms are dried and made into a powder. Then, the powder is mixed with instant coffee. And how does it taste? Some people say mushroom coffee is too bitter. Others say it tastes exactly like coffee. One thing is sure: a cup of instant mushroom coffee has half the caffeine of a regular cup of coffee. Although more research needs to be done on the health benefits of mushroom coffee, it looks like the trend will continue. One day there may even be mushroom milk and sugar for your coffee!

Millions of people love coffee. They drink it every day. But is coffee healthy? Scientists don't agree on the answer. So, people are trying to make coffee healthy. Now there is a new kind of coffee - mushroom coffee!
Chaga is a kind of mushroom. It's black, and grows on trees. Chaga mushrooms are very healthy. They also have a lot of vitamins. In Finland, people make tea with chaga mushrooms. It helps them relax.
Tero Isokauppila is from Finland. He wanted to help people stay healthy. He mixed chaga mushrooms with instant coffee. People liked Isokauppila's special coffee. In 2012, Isokauppila started a company called Four Sigmatic. The company sells coffee with chaga and other mushrooms.
So, is mushroom coffee healthy? Scientists don't know yet. But we do know one thing. It has less caffeine than other coffee. Mushroom coffee is popular. But some people don't like the taste. They say it's better with lots of milk and sugar!




Dopamine Fasting
Health
Sometimes people fast; they don't eat or drink. But there are other kinds of fasts, too. There are dopamine fasts. During a dopamine fast, you don't do enjoyable activities, like listen to music or text friends.
Dopamine is a chemical in the brain. Dopamine tells the body how to move and feel. Some people think enjoyable activities give the brain too much dopamine. Too much dopamine makes people want to do the activities more and more. It's hard to stop! So, they go on a dopamine fast to rest their brains.
On a dopamine fast, some people don't use technology, read books, or go shopping. Other people are very strict. They stop doing most things. What do they do? They might take walks, meditate, and write (with a pen, not a computer).
Does "dopamine" fasting really lessen your dopamine? Many scientists who study the brain say no. They do think it's good to take a break from some habits. An example is always checking messages on your phone. Scientists say it's good to give your brain a break!

Dopamine Fasting
Health
Four times a year, James Sinka, the CEO of a company in California, USA, gives his brain a rest. First, he tells family and friends he won't be in contact for a while. Then, he begins a kind of fast that's becoming popular in the U.S. Normally when you fast, you don't eat (and often drink) for a certain period of time. But when Sinka fasts, he does a lot more than not eat. He turns off his electronic devices, for example, and only uses natural light. This kind of fast is a "dopamine fast."
Dopamine is a complicated brain chemical. It's linked to motivation and feelings. People who take on dopamine fasts believe that stimulating activities flood the brain with dopamine. This causes people to feel "addicted" to those activities. During a dopamine fast, people stop doing those activities to let their brains recharge.
For some people, stimulating activities might include shopping, reading books, listening to music or using the Internet. Sinka is stricter. He also stays away from people and doesn't even make eye contact! What will Sinka do during a fast? He'll write (with a pen), meditate and take walks. He'll also drink water.
There's no rule about how long a dopamine fast should last. But it's common for people to fast for 24 hours. Many people say that after a dopamine fast they have more energy, motivation and focus.
Not everyone believes in dopamine fasting. Many neuroscientists say these fasts have nothing to do with dopamine at all. But they do think it's helpful to temporarily stop doing certain behaviors � like checking your phone � and to give your brain a break!

Dopamine Fasting
Health
Four times a year, James Sinka, the CEO of a start-up, apologizes to his family and friends for being temporarily unreachable. Then he begins a type of fast that's becoming popular in Silicon Valley and other parts of the U.S. While typical fasting involves not eating or drinking for a certain length of time, Sinka's fast involves a lot more. He turns off his smartphone and other devices, stays clear of artificial light, and begins his "dopamine fast."
Dopamine is a complicated brain chemical linked to motivation, emotion, and learning. The thought behind the fast is that stimulating activities and behaviors (like checking social media apps) increase dopamine in your brain. And the more dopamine, the more you feel like you're getting "addicted" to those behaviors. By refraining from doing those activities for a certain period of time - a dopamine fast - you're basically pushing the "reset" button on your brain. 
People conduct dopamine fasts in different ways. Some people avoid enjoyable activities such as shopping, reading books, listening to music and using the Internet. Other people are much stricter. Sinka, for example, refrains from most activities, including interacting with people. He won't even make eye contact. What does Sinka allow himself to do during a fast? He'll write (using pen and paper), take walks, meditate, and drink water to stay hydrated.
A dopamine fast can last as long as you want, though many people fast for at least 24 hours. What are the results? Some fasters claim they feel more motivated the day after a fast. Many feel an increase in energy and focus. Others describe having a deeper connection with people.
However, not everyone is sold on dopamine fasts. Some neuroscientists have stated that these fasts most likely have nothing to do with dopamine. Joshua Berke, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, says he's not aware of any evidence that avoiding stimulating activities can reduce dopamine levels in the brain.
But whether they believe the science or not, most people do agree that taking a break from certain habits is a good idea. So, go ahead and give your brain a break!




Blue Spaces
Health
Are you one of the billions of people around the globe living in a crowded, polluted city? In recent years, cities have been creating "green spaces," like parks and sports fields, to help residents relax and recharge. But did you know that "blue spaces" have similar - and possibly more - benefits to green spaces? Blue spaces are areas with water. These can include oceans, rivers, lakes, and even the fountain at your local shopping mall. Research has shown that living close to, or spending time in, blue spaces is good for your mental and physical health.
Maybe you've already felt that spending time near water improves your mood, but science actually confirms it. Connecting with the natural environment lowers stress levels. At the beach, for example, the sight and sound of the waves ebbing and flowing change your brain patterns. This puts you into a deeply relaxed state of mind - goodbye city stress! Even just looking out at water has been associated with better mental health. Dr. Lewis Elliott, of the University of Exeter, in England, says our mental health can improve by spending around two hours a week in blue spaces. Additionally, scientists have shown that blue makes most people feel calm and peaceful. Several studies have also found that blue boosts creativity.
The emotional benefits that blue spaces provide are also accompanied by physical benefits. Researchers have found that spending time in less polluted environments close to the ocean improves physical health. A specific study, conducted by Professor Michael Depledge and environmental psychologist Mat White showed that people who live by the coast of England report better physical health than those who live further away. How do blue spaces keep us healthy? Being next to the beach means more exposure to sunlight, which our bodies need to make vitamin D. Vitamin D is crucial for keeping bones strong. A beach or waterfront also offers opportunities to be physically active in a serene and natural environment. You can walk or run along the shore, play beach volleyball, or go for a swim.
 
So, next time the city is getting you down, take a break with some blue space!

Do you live in a city? Crowded, polluted cities can be stressful. Stress affects people's health. In recent years, cities have been creating "green spaces," like parks and sports fields, to help people feel healthier. But spending time in "blue spaces" can also help. Blue spaces are areas with water. These can include oceans, rivers, lakes, and even fountains. Research shows that living close to, or spending time in, these blue spaces keeps our minds and bodies healthy.
Many people say spending time near water improves their mood, and scientists agree. Researchers say that people feel less stressed when they are out in nature. In fact, the sight and sound of the waves on a beach actually change people's brain patterns, making them feel relaxed. Even just looking out at water can help. Dr. Lewis Elliott, of the University of Exeter in England, says our mental health can improve by spending around two hours a week in blue spaces. Scientists who study color have also shown that the color blue makes most people feel calm.
So how do blue spaces keep our bodies healthy? Being next to the ocean means more sunlight. Humans need sunlight to make vitamin D, which keeps bones strong. A study by Professor Michael Depledge and environmental psychologist Mat White found that those living by the coast of England are healthier than those living further away.
Being on the beach or waterfront also encourages physical activity. People go walking or jogging along the shore. They play beach sports or go swimming. This improves their physical health.
So, when you need a break from the city, visit a blue space and relax!

Do you know anyone with dementia? Dementia makes it hard to remember things. In Japan, millions of people have dementia. Their lives aren't easy. Many of them are old, and very lonely. In Tokyo, you can visit a special restaurant. Its name is Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.  Why is it special? All the waiters and waitresses have dementia!
People with dementia like working in the restaurant. It helps them feel useful. They can meet new people. Then, they don't feel lonely. "I'm so glad I came. It's been just wonderful," says one 90-year-old waitress.
Waiters don't usually make mistakes at Japanese restaurants. That's not true at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders. The waiters make a lot of mistakes. But customers don't get angry. They expect to get the wrong food!
Shiro Oguni started Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in 2015. He wanted people in Japan to meet people with dementia. He hoped to change their feelings about people with dementia. At Restaurant of Mistaken Orders, people are all just people.

Health
In Japan, 4.6 million people have dementia, and they are mainly older people. Two-thirds of them live at home, and often feel very lonely. People with dementia have a hard time remembering things. So, it may seem strange to give them a job where memory is important. But at a special pop-up restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, all the waiters and waitresses have dementia. It's called Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.
In most Japanese restaurants, waiters and waitresses almost never make mistakes. However, that's not true at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders. For example, one waiter served hot coffee with a straw, and another sat down at the table with customers. So, what's the point? Working helps people with dementia feel useful. They meet new people at the restaurant, and the work gives them confidence. "I was worried. I wasn't sure if I could do this job," says one 90-year-old waitress, "but I'm so glad I came. It's been just wonderful."
Shiro Oguni started Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in 2015. He got the idea while directing a film about dementia. He heard many negative opinions about people with dementia. Oguni hoped to change these opinions. He decided to create a place where customers could interact with people who have dementia. Customers know they probably won't get what they ordered, so they just relax and enjoy the experience. When they see the waiters and waitresses having a good time, they begin to see people with dementia in a more positive way. Food blogger Mizuho Kudo wrote a favorable review about her meal - even though her order was wrong!
What do you think? Would you eat at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders?

Health
Have you ever met a person with dementia? According to the World Health Organization, around 50 million people in the world have dementia, and they're mainly older people. In Japan, for example, 4.6 million people have dementia. Two-thirds of these people live at home, often isolated from society. The condition affects brain functions including memory, making it hard for a person with dementia to remember things. It might seem impossible for a person who can't remember things to work as a waiter, but there is a pop-up restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, where everyone on the waitstaff has dementia. It's called Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.
Receiving perfect service is part of Japanese restaurant culture, and mistakes are rarely made. That isn't true for Restaurant of Mistaken Orders, where waitstaff might sit down with customers at their tables or serve hot coffee with a straw. However, at this restaurant, customers are very understanding of the elderly volunteer waiters who love having a job to do. Working in the pleasant atmosphere of the restaurant gives the waiters a sense of purpose and a chance to interact with new people, and it boosts their self-confidence. "I was worried. I wasn't sure if I could do this job," says one 90-year-old waitress, "but I'm so glad I came. It's been just wonderful."
Television director Shiro Oguni got the idea for Restaurant of Mistaken Orders while working on a documentary about dementia. The experience helped him understand the scope of the problem as well as the daily challenges that people with dementia face. Oguni decided to create a place that would change negative opinions of people with dementia, opening the first pop-up in 2015.
Restaurant of Mistaken Orders is less about getting the food you ordered, and more about interacting with people who have dementia. Diners know they probably won't get what they ordered, so they can relax and enjoy the experience. When they see the waitstaff having a good time, they also begin to see people with dementia in a more positive way. The restaurant has even gotten attention on social media. When food blogger Mizuho Kudo ordered a hamburger and received dumplings instead, she still posted a favorable review.
So, would you like to eat at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders?





Today, most processed foods have sugar. But too much sugar is dangerous to your health. Some people sweeten their foods with sugar substitutes, but many of these are unhealthy, too. What if there was a healthy sugar substitute? A company in Mexico called XiliNat (pronounced Hill-ee-natt) is making just that!
Javier Larragoiti is a Mexican biochemist who founded XiliNat in 2016. When Larragoiti was 18, his father was diagnosed with diabetes. People with diabetes must avoid foods with sugar because their bodies don't make enough insulin to control the sugar in their blood. But the sugar-free lifestyle was too challenging for Larragoiti's father. He tried using sugar substitutes, such as stevia and sucralose, to satisfy his "sweet tooth", but he hated the taste, so it was hard for him to stick to his diet. Larragoiti decided to help. 
Larragoiti began researching the sweetener xylitol, used in products such as gum and candy. Xylitol looks and tastes like sugar, but has fewer calories. Another benefit is that it actually keeps teeth healthy by protecting them from cavities. Xylitol often comes from wood, and is very expensive to make. Larragoiti looked for a cheaper way to make xylitol, so that it could be accessible to everyone.
After a lot of research, Larragoiti found a solution. Through his company XiliNat, he patented a process that makes xylitol from corn cobs instead of wood. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Mexico grows 27.5 million tons of corn each year. However, only the kernels are used, leaving the cobs behind as agricultural waste. Farmers often burn the cobs, polluting the atmosphere. XiliNat helps the environment by buying farmers' organic waste from the corn, and using it to make the xylitol. XiliNat is currently producing one ton of the product each year.
So far, XiliNat is succeeding in its mission to avoid pollution, reduce health issues and provide extra income to corn farmers. And the company's product could help the approximately 400 million people in the world suffering from diabetes. What does Larragoiti's father think? "My dad is super happy," says Larragoiti. "He uses my product every day and he's willing not to cheat on his diet anymore!"

Too much sugar is dangerous to your health. People who are trying to eat healthier often use sugar substitutes. But many sugar substitutes are actually unhealthy. Now, a company in Mexico called XiliNat (pronounced Hill-ee-natt), has created a healthy sugar substitute made from corn.
Javier Larragoiti started XiliNat to help his father, who has diabetes. With diabetes, a person's body doesn't make enough insulin to control the sugar in their blood. So, people with diabetes can't eat foods with sugar. After Larragoiti's father found out he had diabetes, he had a hard time eating less sugar. He tried using sugar substitutes, but he hated the taste. Looking for a solution, Larragoiti, a biochemist, began researching xylitol. The sugar substitute, used in products such as gum and candy, looks and tastes like sugar but has fewer calories. Another advantage of xylitol is that it keeps teeth healthy by protecting them from cavities. Xylitol usually comes from wood, and is very expensive to make. Larragoiti found a cheaper way to make xylitol. He uses corn cobs instead of wood.
In Mexico, 27.5 million tons of corn are grown each year. However, only the kernels are used; the rest is waste. Farmers often burn the cobs, which pollutes the atmosphere. By buying the corn waste and using it to make xylitol, XiliNat helps the environment and the farmers. Now, instead of burning the waste, farmers receive extra income by selling it to XiliNat.
XiliNat's product could help the approximately 400 million people in the world with diabetes. Larragoiti says his father happily uses XiliNat's product every day... and doesn't cheat on his diet anymore.

Do you put artificial sweeteners in your food? Many people think that artificial sweeteners are healthier than sugar. But most artificial sweeteners are unhealthy. Now, a company in Mexico called XiliNat is making a healthy sweetener.
Javier Larragoiti is a biochemist. He started the company XiliNat to help people who have diabetes. With diabetes, a person's body doesn't make enough insulin to control the sugar in their blood. People with diabetes can't eat foods with sugar.
XiliNat makes a sweetener called xylitol. Xylitol looks and tastes like sugar. But it has fewer calories than sugar. Companies usually make xylitol from wood. Using wood costs a lot of money. XiliNat uses corn cobs to make xylitol. Using corn cobs is cheaper than using wood. Mexican farmers grow 27.5 million tons of corn each year. They sell the corn kernels, and burn the rest of the plant. This pollutes the environment. XiliNat buys the farmers' corn cobs. So Xilinat helps the farmers and the environment.
XiliNat will also help the millions of people in the world who have diabetes.




The Healthiest Snack
Health
Do you like to exercise? Exercise helps keep you healthy. But what if you don't enjoy going to the gym? Or what if you just can't find the time? Then try an exercise snack, instead!
An "exercise snack" means doing a little exercise in a very short amount of time. Experts say adults need 150 minutes of exercise a week to stay healthy. But you don't have to go to the gym to get exercise. You can climb up and down stairs a few times a day. You can dance to your favorite song. You can also run up and down a hallway for four minutes. Every minute of "exercise snacking" you do each day helps keep you fit.
Exercise snacking burns calories and helps you sleep better. It also helps your posture. In one study, researchers found that exercise snacks make your heart and lungs stronger.
So, what are you waiting for? Start snacking!

Are you someone who can't find time to exercise? Well, there's a solution to your problem - exercise snacks!
The phrase "exercise snack" refers to very short, intense sessions of exercise spread out over a day. And you can do them almost anywhere. Try climbing up and down flights of stairs, dancing to your favorite song, or running back and forth along a hallway for four minutes. Professor of kinesiology Martin Gibala believes people don't need an hour-long workout at the gym to get fit. Gibala led a recent study from McMaster University in Canada. According to the study, exercise snacks can make your heart and lungs stronger, and improve your overall physical fitness.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sitting too much (six or more hours per day) is one of the leading factors for fatal diseases worldwide. The WHO recommends adults do 150 minutes of exercise a week to stay healthy. However, this exercise doesn't have to be done all at once. Short bursts of exercise for just a few minutes (spread out over a day) add up over time.
So, instead of taking a coffee break at work, "...why not take a movement break?" asks Lauren Parsons, a wellness specialist and personal trainer. Exercise snacking improves sleep and helps your posture, while also burning calories. Parsons believes that if you can find time to brush your teeth every day to keep them healthy, you can take "a minute here, a minute there, throughout the day and see what a difference it makes."
You probably won't hear this often, but... start snacking!

Are you someone who can't find time to exercise? You might have even tried going to the gym, but found it inconvenient or intimidating. Well, there's a solution to your exercise problem - exercise snacks!
An "exercise snack" isn't some sort of nutrition bar. The phrase refers to very brief intervals of high-intensity training spread out over a day. This may include climbing up and down flights of stairs, dancing to your favorite song, or running back and forth along a hallway for four minutes.
 
"Some people have the notion that 'exercise' means changing into spandex and heading to the gym for an hour-long workout," says professor of kinesiology Martin Gibala. But that's not the only way to get fit. Gibala is the lead author of a recent study from McMaster University in Canada. According to the study, exercise snacks can strengthen your heart and lungs, and improve your overall physical fitness.
The term "exercise snack" was coined in a 2014 study from the University of Otago in New Zealand. In the study, one-minute intervals of intense exercise before a meal helped people with diabetes control their blood sugar.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), living a sedentary lifestyle is one of the leading risk factors worldwide for illnesses which can be fatal, such as heart disease and diabetes. Being sedentary is defined as sitting for six or more hours per day, which is a concern since so many workers sit this long or longer. The WHO recommends adults do 150 minutes of exercise a week to stay healthy. This exercise doesn't have to be done in large chunks. It can be done in small "bites". Short bursts of exercise spread out over a day add up over time.
So, instead of taking a coffee break at work, "...why not take a movement break?" asks Lauren Parsons, a wellness specialist and personal trainer. In addition to burning calories, the benefits of exercise snacking include better sleep and improved posture.

Sleep on It!
Health
How many hours of sleep do you get each night? Most doctors agree that good sleep habits keep the human body healthy. Although the World Health Organization recommends that adults sleep eight hours each night, more than a third of American adults don't get enough sleep. In recent years, researchers have been discovering the serious consequences that lack of sleep has on human health.
Research links sleep deprivation to health problems, including cancer, heart attacks, Alzheimer's, and obesity. For example, people who are sleep deprived will actually eat somewhere between three to five hundred calories more each day than normal. Lack of sleep also contributes to workplace injuries and decreased productivity. In addition, 20 percent of all car accidents each year are caused by tired drivers - that's more than one million!
Dr. Matthew Walker, professor at the University of California, Berkeley in the USA, is the founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science. In his bestselling book Why We Sleep, Walker discusses the global "sleep-loss epidemic", and the importance of getting enough sleep. For instance, sleep strengthens the immune system, helping the body fight illness. Additionally, sleeping before and after learning new information helps you remember it better than if you hadn't slept. During sleep, the body restores itself. "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day," says Walker. Walker also explains that humans sleep in 90-minute cycles. At the end of each cycle, they go into deep sleep. But "One cycle isn't enough to do all the work. You need four or five cycles to get all the benefit," says Walker.
Many people think of sleep deprivation as a badge of honor, labelling those who sleep eight hours each night "lazy". The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) says around 47 million adults don't get a restorative night's sleep. The organization wants to educate people, to help change society's views about prioritizing sleep. The NSF recommends later start times for teenagers in school, and flexible work schedules for adults. Working and studying during the part of the day when people are most alert improves productivity and academic performance.

Doctors say that adults need eight hours of sleep each night. But many people sleep less. This is a mistake.  Getting enough sleep is very important.
First, sleep keeps people healthy. People get very sick when they don't sleep enough. Also, people who don't sleep enough can't work well or quickly. It can also be dangerous. They can get hurt more easily. Tired drivers cause one million car accidents each year!
Dr. Matthew Walker is a sleep scientist. Walker explains that sleep helps our brains. Sleeping makes our memory better. Sleep also helps our bodies heal more quickly when we are sick, or hurt.
Scientists say we need to change our ideas about sleep. They believe that school should start later for students. With enough sleep, students are able to learn better. People should also be able to begin their workday later.

Do you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses? If not, you probably know someone who does. According to the World Health Organization, more than 200 million people in the world have vision problems, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness. While many choose to wear glasses or contact lenses to improve their vision, others choose to have invasive laser eye surgery for a more permanent cure. But what if you could see better without eyewear or surgery? A new medical invention could be the solution - it's called "Nano-Drops".
Nano-Drops are special eye drops that can correct vision problems. The drops work together with a smartphone and a small laser device attached to the smartphone. Nano-Drops were developed in Israel by a team of researchers, including ophthalmologist Dr. David Smadja from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, and Professor Zeev Zalevsky from Bar-Ilan University.
Unlike surgery, the new Nano-Drops method is painless and non-invasive. The method involves three steps. First, patients use a smartphone app to measure the adjustments that their eyes need. Then, based on the information from the app, a laser pattern is created and projected onto the surface of the cornea for a few milliseconds. This creates tiny grooves in the cornea. Finally, the patient puts Nano-Drops containing nanoparticles into each eye. These special particles enter the grooves, making the necessary corrections to the eyes. The patented Nano-Drops method is also convenient, as the process of correction can be done at home without the need for a medical doctor. The downside is that as the eye gradually heals itself, patients will have to repeat the process every month or two.
The Nano-Drops have already successfully treated nearsightedness and farsightedness in pigs (whose eyes are very similar to human eyes). Testing on humans will begin soon. "I hope that within two years the product may be available [on] the market," says Prof. Zalevsky. Dr. Smadja feels confident that this revolutionary invention could help many people say "goodbye" to their glasses!

Dr. David Smadja, an ophthalmologist, and a team of researchers in Israel have developed a new medical invention. It could help people see better without glasses, contact lenses, or surgery - it's called "Nano-Drops".
There are three steps to using Nano-Drops. First, patients measure their eyesight using a smartphone app. Based on the information from the app, a laser pattern is created. Then, the laser pattern is projected onto the eye. In less than a second, the laser makes tiny grooves on the eye's surface. Finally, the patient puts Nano-Drops into each eye. The nanoparticles in the drops enter the grooves, making the necessary corrections to the eyes.
The World Health Organization says that more than 200 million people in the world have vision problems, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness. Some people wear glasses or contact lenses to see more clearly. Others choose to have laser eye surgery to fix their vision more permanently. But eye surgery can be painful. The new Nano-Drops are painless, as well as non-invasive. Nano-Drops also make treatment easier because it can be done at home, without a doctor. However, Nano-Drops' effects don't last forever, because the eye gradually heals itself. Patients will have to use the Nano-Drops every month or two.
Researchers have already tested Nano-Drops on pigs, and will soon begin testing on humans. They hope that Nano-Drops will be on the market within two years. Dr. Smadja believes that this invention could help many people say "Goodbye" to their glasses!

Do you wear glasses or contact lenses? Well, you may not need them anymore! A new invention can help you see better without glasses. Say "Hello" to "Nano-Drops"!
Nano-Drops are special eye drops. There are three steps to using Nano-Drops. First, the patient checks their eyes with a smartphone app. The app gets information about the patient's eyes. Then, a laser makes tiny cuts on top of the eye - it happens in less than a second! Finally, the patient puts Nano-Drops into their eyes. The nanoparticles in the Nano-Drops go into the small cuts in the eye. Now, the patient can see well. Patients will have to do this process every month or two. But they can do it at home without a doctor.
Researchers in Israel made Nano-Drops. They tested Nano-Drops on pigs' eyes. Next, they want to test the drops on humans. The researchers are very excited. They hope that Nano-Drops will be for sale very soon. Say "Goodbye" to glasses!





Hearing aids help people hear. Canes help people walk. Medical devices help people with many different health conditions. But these devices don't always look nice.

Now, things are changing. Researchers, designers, and people with health conditions are working together. They are making medical devices that are fashionable! You can see 70 of these devices at an exhibition in New York City. It is called "Access+Ability".

One device in the exhibition is called "Earring Aid. It is a hearing aid that looks like jewelry. At Access+Ability, there are also covers for prosthetic legs.  The covers come in different colors and designs.

At "Access+Ability" you can even see a pair of trendy Nike shoes. The shoes have zippers that go all around the shoe. This makes the shoes easy to put on. Nike made these shoes because of a boy with cerebral palsy. The boy wrote a letter to Nike. He asked them to make shoes he can put on by himself. So they did!

These new medical devices are changing people's lives.

What if people could choose prosthetic leg covers like they choose shirts? Most products that help people with health conditions, such as hearing aids and prosthetic legs, are useful but not very attractive.

Researchers, designers, and people with physical, cognitive, and sensory challenges are working together to change this. They have designed many products that are both useful and fashionable. You can see more than 70 of these products at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in an exhibition called "Access+Ability".

One product, called the "Emma" watch was created by a graphic designer named Emma Lawton. Lawton has Parkinson's disease. In order to help her control her hand, she made a watch that uses a special technology called haptic vibration. The "Magnetic Shirt" also helps people with Parkinson's. The shirt has magnets instead of buttons, so it's easier to close. One of the shirt's designers, Maura Horton, wanted to make a shirt that her husband, who has Parkinson's, can put on by himself.

The exhibition also includes a pair of Nike shoes. The shoes have zippers that wrap all the way around the shoe. This makes it easier to put them on. Nike made these shoes because of a letter from a 13-year-old boy with cerebral palsy. He wanted a cool pair of shoes he could put on without help. Now, he has one!

At Access+Ability, there are also prosthetic leg covers, in different patterns. And "Earring Aid", designed by artist Elana Langer, is a hearing aid. It is decorated with Swarovski crystals, making them look like jewelry.

These new products not only help people physically, they help them emotionally, too!

Imagine someone with a prosthetic leg choosing a leg cover from their closet as if choosing a pair of pants. Or how about someone accessorizing with a pair of hearing aids? Traditionally, medically assistive products, such as hearing aids, prosthetic limbs, compression socks, and canes, have served purely functional purposes; fashion has never played a role. Until now.

Thanks to the collaboration of researchers, designers, and people with physical, cognitive, and sensory challenges, a range of products has been developed to be not just functional, but fashionable, too. More than 70 of these products are on display at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, in an exhibition called "Access+Ability".

Most of the products in Access+Ability were designed or inspired by someone with a disability. The "Emma" watch is the creation of graphic designer Emma Lawton, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2013. The trendy-looking watch uses special technology called haptic vibration to allow wearers with Parkinson's to regain control of their hands.

The "Magnetic Shirt" is another example of a fashionable yet functional solution for people with Parkinson's. Designed by Duncan Fitzsimons and Maura Horton, the shirt closes with magnets, which are easier to use than buttons. Horton designed the shirt to help her husband - who has Parkinson's - dress independently, to help him keep his dignity.

Also in the exhibition is a pair of stylish Nike shoes, which came about as the result of a letter written by Matthew Walzer, a 13-year-old with cerebral palsy. Walzer asked for a pair of shoes he could put on without help. Nike responded with its "FlyEase" shoes. They have wraparound zippers, which make them easy to put on.

Also on display are Alleles Design Studios' prosthetic leg covers, which come in many colors and patterns. Their mission is "to do for prosthetics what fashion did for eyeglasses". Artist Elana Langer has the same mission for her "Earring Aid", hearing aids decorated with Swarovski crystals, so they look like jewelry.

The co-curator of Access+Ability, Cara McCarty, explains that these products "put the magnifying glass up to something others might experience every day". These new products not only improve the lives of many people physically, but emotionally, too!




People Who Don't Forget
Health
Can you remember what you did every day for the past year? This is an easy task for someone with HSAM. HSAM stands for Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory. It's the ability to recall what you did every day starting from a young age (often around 10 or 12). Name a date within this range and someone with HSAM will remember what day of the week it was, what he or she did that day, and even what the weather was like.
Jill Price was the first person to be identified with HSAM. In 2000, at age 34, she was overwhelmed by the memories flooding her head. So she made an appointment with neurobiologist Dr. James McGaugh at the University of California to see if he could help her.
McGaugh had never met anyone like Price. Each time he mentioned a date, Price told him what historical event happened on that day. Even though HSAM involves recalling personal experiences, if a news event coincides with one of those experiences, a person with HSAM will remember it, too. Price knew, for example, that famous singer/actor Bing Crosby had died on Friday, October 14, 1977, because she remembered hearing it on the car radio on her way to soccer practice.
Since Price's meeting with McGaugh, about 60 additional people have been identified with HSAM (also called hyperthymesia). Brain scans on HSAM subjects reveal structural differences in certain areas of their brains. But scientists don't know if these differences are what cause HSAM, or if the constant recall of memories creates these differences. They are trying to find out more. McGaugh says people with HSAM are "very poor at forgetting," which is why studying their brains can be very helpful. "We know an awful lot about the conditions which create memories," McGaugh explains. "We know very little about what happens when people forget."
This inability to forget can be difficult for people with HSAM.  A bad memory from 20 years ago can still feel fresh. "If I'm remembering or recalling a memory, I'm almost reliving it emotionally as well," says 32-year-old Joey DeGrandis. But DeGrandis also appreciates his HSAM memory. "Even though sometimes the bad memories may haunt me, I think that overall I'm happy to have the ability."

Can you remember what you did every day last year? This is an easy task for someone with HSAM. HSAM is the ability to remember what you did every single day starting from a certain age (often around 10 or 12). HSAM stands for Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory. When people with HSAM are told a date, they can recall what they did on that day, what day of the week it was, and even what the weather was like.
Jill Price was the first person identified with HSAM. In 2000, Price met with neurobiologist Dr. James McGaugh of the University of California. McGaugh tested Price's memory. He named dates, and Price told him what world events had happened on those dates. Someone with HSAM can recall a world event if it coincided with a personal experience. For example, Price remembered that singer Bing Crosby died on October 14, 1977, because she heard the news on the radio on her way to soccer practice.
Today, researchers know of about 60 people with HSAM. And they are finding out more about the HSAM brain. McGaugh describes people with HSAM as being "very poor at forgetting," which is why they can be a goldmine for scientists. According to McGaugh, scientists know a lot about how memories are created, but know little about what happens when people forget.
Being unable to forget isn't always a good thing.  A negative experience from years ago can feel fresh. Joey DeGrandis, a 32-year-old with HSAM, says that when he recalls a memory, the old emotions come back, too. But overall, DeGrandis appreciates his HSAM. "I'm happy to have the ability," he says.

Jill Price can remember what she did every day when she was 12 years old. And she can remember what she did every day after that! Price has HSAM. HSAM is a kind of "super" memory. People with HSAM remember most days of their lives.
In the year 2000, Price met a scientist named James McGaugh. McGaugh tested Price's memory. McGaugh picked dates in the calendar. Price told McGaugh what news event happened on each day. She remembered because she could recall what she was doing at the time. For example, Price remembered that on October 14, 1977, her mother drove her to soccer practice. On the way, they heard the news that the singer Bing Crosby died. So Price remembered that Bing Crosby died on October 14, 1977.
Price was the first person scientists ever saw with HSAM. Today, scientists know of 61 people with HSAM. Joey DeGrandis is one of these people. He says having HSAM can be hard. Some memories you want to forget. But he says, "Overall, I'm happy to have the ability."




What Color Is It?
Health
How do people see colors? There are special cells inside the human eye. These cells send messages to the brain about color. Look at a blue dress. How do you know it's blue? The special cells tell your brain it's blue. But some people's cells don't work correctly. They send the wrong message to the brain. People who get the wrong messages from their eyes have color blindness.
People with color blindness see colors differently from other people. One in 12 men and one in 200 women have color blindness. Nothing can cure color blindness. But wearing special glasses can help. One company that makes these glasses is Enchroma. The lenses in Enchroma's glasses have filters. Many people with color blindness tried Enchroma's glasses. They put them on and... wow! Suddenly, people with color blindness saw real colors. And they can see a beautiful blue dress, too!

What Color Is It?
Health
Is it white and gold, or blue and black? In February 2015, a picture of a striped dress was shared on the Internet. More than 30 million people saw the photograph, and they couldn't all agree about the colors they saw. Suddenly, everyone was talking about how humans perceive color. The confusion about the color of the dress may have helped some viewers understand people who have color blindness.
The human eye has special cells called cones, which tell the brain what colors to perceive. When a person with color blindness looks at certain colors, the cones send the wrong message to their brain about the true color. Like many people who saw "the dress", color-blind people see colors differently.
One in 12 men and one in 200 women have color blindness. Red-green color blindness is the most common type. People with color blindness can have many difficulties. Young schoolchildren might feel embarrassed if they use the "wrong" color. Drivers with color blindness are more likely to cause traffic accidents - they can confuse red and green lights. People with color blindness are even unable to work in some professions.
There's no cure for color blindness. However, different companies have developed glasses to correct the problem. One company, Enchroma, makes glasses which allow around 80% of people with color blindness to see colors that they never could before. The lenses on Enchroma's glasses have filters that change how the wearer perceives colors. The glasses, introduced in 2012, aren't cheap - they can cost up to $429 . But Enchroma's glasses could help people see the actual colors of that famous dress!

In February 2015, a photograph of a striped dress went viral on the Internet. More than 30 million people looked at the photograph, but not everyone could agree on its color scheme. Those who said it was blue and black argued with those who saw it as white and gold. The debate became a worldwide, social media sensation, and shined a spotlight on the way humans perceive color. And some viewers, particularly those who saw colors that weren't there, got a small sense of what life must be like for people with color blindness.
Color blindness is a genetic condition that occurs when special cells in the eye called cones are abnormal. Cones tell the brain what colors to perceive. When a person with color blindness looks at certain colors, the abnormal cones give the brain the wrong message about the true color. Like many people who saw the blue and black dress as white and gold, color-blind people see colors differently.
One in 12 men and one in 200 women have color blindness, and red-green color blindness is the most common type. Color blindness brings with it many challenges. Young schoolchildren sometimes feel embarrassed when they use the "wrong" color to complete a task. Color-blind adults who can't differentiate between red or green traffic signals are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents. In Romania and Turkey, people with color blindness aren't even permitted to get a driver's license. Additionally, some professions, in the arts and military for instance, simply aren't options for people with color blindness.
Currently, there's no cure for genetic color blindness. However, different companies have developed glasses to correct the problem. One company, Enchroma, makes indoor lenses and sunglasses with filters that change the way light enters the eye, affecting how the wearer perceives colors. These glasses enable around 80% of people with color blindness to see colors that they never could before. Although the glasses are expensive (costs range from $349 to $429 dollars), millions of dollars' worth of glasses have been sold since being introduced in 2012. While not exactly a cure, Enchroma's glasses might help people with color blindness correctly identify the colors of that famous dress!




Can Boredom Be Good For You?
Health
What makes you feel bored? Many people are bored when they do routine tasks, such as washing the dishes, cutting vegetables for a salad, waiting for a bus, or standing in line. Well, did you know that being bored is not a waste of time? Taking time to be bored, to allow your brain to relax and wander, can actually be good for you!

Do you want to be more creative? Being bored may help you with that. Psychologist Sandi Mann from the University of Central Lancashire in England wanted to understand the effect of boredom on our lives. In one study, Dr. Mann had two groups of people complete a creative task: finding as many uses as they could for two cups. Before doing the creative task, one group performed a boring activity: they copied telephone numbers from a phone book. The other group did not do the boring task. Dr. Mann discovered that participants who completed the boring task were much more creative in coming up with ideas for the cups. She believes that boredom encourages people's minds to wander, which leads them to more creative ways of thinking. Dr. Mann doesn't think we should fear boredom. "We should embrace it," she says. She also believes it is important for children to be bored. "Unlike so many parents today, I am quite happy when my kids whine that they are bored. Finding ways to amuse themselves is an important skill."

Being bored can also encourage you to seek out activities that help other people. While at the University of Limerick, in Ireland, psychologist Wijnand van Tilburg researched boredom. He found that bored people often feel that their actions are meaningless, and they respond to their boredom by seeking out meaningful activities. "Boredom makes people long for different and purposeful activities, and as a result they turn towards more challenging and meaningful activities," explains Dr. van Tilburg. He believes his research shows that boredom can promote behavior that benefits society.

So, sit back, relax, let your mind wander, and feel good about being bored. It could help you become more creative and encourage you to find more meaningful ways to spend your time.

Super Suit
Health
It's hard for some people to walk, sit, or stand. Their bones and muscles are weak. Now, there is a special suit to help these people. It's called the "Aura Powered Suit".

People wear the suit under their clothes. It looks like gym clothes. The suit uses special technology that soldiers use. The technology in the Aura Powered Suit helps people climb stairs, sit down, and stand up. The suit supports a person's torso, hips, and legs.

On the suit there are pods. The pods are in the shape of hexagons. Inside the pods are motors, batteries, and control boards. The pods sit over certain muscles. The pods help these muscles work.

A company called Superflex made the suit. A designer named Yves Behar helped them make it. A sample of the Aura Powered Suit was in the London Design Museum. Many people came to see it.

Rich Mahoney is the cofounder of Superflex. He thinks the Aura Powered Suit will improve people's lives and keep them healthier longer.

Aging is a fact of life. We can't escape it. But what if there were a way to make our bodies more mobile as we age? Now there is - thanks to technology company Superflex and designer Yves Behar. It's called the "Aura Powered Suit". And it's putting 'power' back into the bodies of those who need it.

The Superflex team worked together with Behar and his team of industrial designers at fuseproject design agency, to create the Aura Powered Suit. The super suit is designed to help people with mobility issues, such as seniors or people with physical disabilities. The suit uses technology originally developed to help soldiers in the army. The technology in the Aura Powered Suit supports people who have difficulty climbing stairs or standing up from a sitting position.

The Aura Powered Suit is made from lightweight materials. It is worn under regular clothing. The suit looks similar to gym clothing. It was important for Behar to come up with a design that looked modern and stylish.

The difference between the Aura Powered Suit and other workout outfits is that it has pods. The pods are in the shape of hexagons. The pods are clustered around particular muscles. Inside the pods are motors, batteries, and control boards. The pods work with the body, stretching along with the wearer's movements. The suit supports the torso, hips, and legs, as a person gets up, sits down, or stays standing.

A prototype of the Aura Powered Suit was first shown at the London Design Museum exhibition, New Old. The cofounder and CEO of Superflex, Rich Mahoney, believes that "Superflex's new powered clothing technology means that people will lead fuller, healthier, and more rewarding lives."

Aging is an eventuality that humans cannot escape. Yet, what if there were a way to increase the mobility of our aging bodies? Now there is - thanks to technology company Superflex and designer Yves Behar. It's called the "Aura Powered Suit", and it's putting the 'power' back into the bodies of those who need it.

Superflex collaborated with Behar and his team of industrial designers at fuseproject design agency, to create a super powered suit. The suit aims to increase the quality of life of people with mobility issues, such as seniors or people with physical disabilities. The suit uses technology originally developed for the military, to help soldiers carry heavy loads and increase their jumping capabilities.

As a person's muscles and bones lose strength, it becomes increasingly difficult to accomplish even the simplest physical tasks. The technology used in Superflex's suit aids people who struggle to climb stairs or stand up from a sitting position.

The Aura Powered Suit is expertly designed using lightweight materials. It's worn under a person's regular clothing. Outwardly, it looks similar to stylish workout clothing people wear in the gym. This is an important feature, as it doesn't resemble the geriatric style of clothing or equipment designed for similar purposes.

The difference between the Aura Powered Suit and any other sleek workout outfit is that it has pods attached to it. The hexagonal-shaped pods are clustered around particular muscles. Inside the pods are motors, batteries, and control boards. The pods are the "electric muscles" of the suit. They work with the body, expanding and contracting with the wearer's movements. The suit is meant to provide support to the torso, hips, and legs, as a person gets up, sits down, or remains standing.

A prototype of the Aura Powered Suit was first displayed at the London Design Museum exhibition, New Old. Cofounder and CEO of Superflex, Rich Mahoney, believes that, "Superflex's new powered clothing technology means that people will lead fuller, healthier, and more rewarding lives."

Coffee Power!
World
We drink 500 billion cups of coffee per year globally. All this coffee -17 million cups per day in the United Kingdom (UK) alone - produces half a million tons of waste coffee grounds per year. The coffee grounds usually end up in landfills, adding to the world's pollution problem. A British company, called bio-bean, had a good idea. Bio-bean collects the coffee grounds and uses them to produce an eco-friendly fuel.
Bio-bean is the first company in the world to industrialize the process of turning coffee grounds into biofuel. Bio-bean's founder, Arthur Kay, was inspired while designing a coffee shop for a class assignment at UCL (University College London), in the UK. Kay quickly realized just how much waste is produced when preparing coffee. After doing research, Kay found that coffee grounds (which contain oil) could be turned into biofuel. In 2015, he opened bio-bean. It was the first factory in the world to convert used coffee grounds into fuel.
 
Coffee shops all over the UK are more than happy to assist with bio-bean's worthy cause. They usually have to pay a company to dispose of their coffee grounds; bio-bean does it for free. At bio-bean's factory, in Cambridgeshire, UK, it only takes a few hours to dry the grounds, extract the oil, and compress the dried material into various bio-bean products. The company makes biomass pellets, which can be used to heat large buildings, such as office buildings and airports. Bio-bean also makes Coffee Logs (biomass briquettes). They are a cheaper alternative to wood logs, to be used for fireplaces, stoves, and barbecues.
Can you imagine a coffee-powered car? Well, bio-bean is also working on producing biodiesel from the oil extracted from coffee grounds. The biodiesel could replace fossil fuel in many modes of transportation. Kay's dream is for bio-bean to power London buses. According to Kay, London's coffee grounds would be enough to power every bus in London. Kay, who describes himself as a "green energy entrepreneur", wants bio-bean to expand far beyond the UK. Who knows what coffee will be powering next?

We drink 500 billion cups of coffee per year, globally. In the United Kingdom (UK) alone, people drink 17 million cups per day. Preparing all that coffee produces many tons of leftover coffee grounds. These grounds end up in landfills. A British company called bio-bean had a good idea. It collects coffee grounds and turns them into eco-friendly fuel.
Arthur Kay is the founder of bio-bean. He got the idea for recycling coffee grounds when he was in college. While doing an assignment in which he had to design a coffee shop, Kay quickly realized just how much waste is produced when making coffee. Kay learned that coffee grounds (which contain oil) could be used to make biofuel for heating. In 2015, Kay opened bio-bean's factory. It was the first factory in the world to turn used coffee grounds into fuel.
In addition to the environmental benefits, bio-bean helps coffee shops save money. Coffee shops usually have to pay a company to pick up their coffee grounds. But bio-bean picks them up for free. Once the grounds arrive at the bio-bean factory, in Cambridgeshire, UK, they're dried, and the oil is removed. The dried material is turned into biomass pellets and Coffee Logs (biomass briquettes). The biomass pellets are used to heat large buildings. The Coffee Logs are used for fireplaces, stoves, and barbecues.
Bio-bean is also experimenting with creating biodiesel from coffee grounds. In the future, biodiesel could replace the gas we use today to power our vehicles. Kay hopes London's coffee grounds will one day be powering all of London's buses.

Coffee Power!
World
What happens after you make fresh coffee? You get coffee grounds. These are tiny pieces of crushed coffee beans. Most people throw the coffee grounds in the garbage. All around the world people drink coffee - 500 billion cups every year. All this coffee makes lots of coffee grounds! To throw out the coffee grounds, coffee shops pay for a truck to come and take them away.
But a company called "bio-bean" does something better. It recycles the coffee grounds. Bio-bean takes coffee shops' grounds for free. Their trucks bring the coffee grounds to a factory. At the factory, workers dry the coffee grounds. Then, they turn them into a special fuel. It's called biofuel. Biofuel makes houses and buildings stay warm. People can use this eco-friendly fuel in fireplaces, stoves, and barbecues. In the future, bio-bean wants to make biofuel for cars, too. So, coffee doesn't only give energy to people. It gives energy to machines too!





The jackfruit is a very large fruit that grows on trees. Scientists think it could help end world hunger.
In some countries, it's very hard to grow enough food for everyone. These countries have problems with water. Sometimes there is too much water, and sometimes there isn't enough. Important crops, such as wheat and corn, don't grow well in these places. But jackfruit does grow well.
Jackfruit is very nutritious. It has a lot of protein and vitamins, which keep people strong. People feel full after they eat jackfruit. You can pick a jackfruit right off a tree, cut it open, and eat the sweet flesh inside. Or, you can dry it, then use it to make other foods - even noodles and ice cream! Inside the jackfruit is sap. People use the sap as glue.
Scientists say jackfruit is a "miracle food" because it is so nutritious and easy to grow. What do you think?

The Miracle Fruit
World
What's big, green, bumpy, and grows on trees? It's jackfruit - and it could be the answer to world hunger.
Some developing countries don't have enough food to feed their citizens. These countries have many floods and droughts because of global warming. This makes it difficult for traditional crops, such as wheat and corn, to grow. Researchers say that planting jackfruit, instead of these crops, could help - especially since jackfruit doesn't need a lot of water to grow. Jackfruit has many nutrients, such as protein and vitamins A, B and C. Other nutrients include calcium and iron. Jackfruit is also very filling. "If you just eat 10 or 12 bulbs of this fruit, you don't need food for another half a day," says Shyamala Reddy, a researcher at the University of Agricultural Sciences in India.
Jackfruits are very large, weighing anywhere from 10 to 100 pounds (4.5 - 45 kg). The fruit's light green rind is thick and bumpy. Inside the fruit are seeds surrounded by edible bulbs. Each part of the jackfruit can be used. The sweet, inner flesh can be eaten raw. It can also be dried and used in products such as jams, juices, ice cream and more. Jackfruit seeds are also useful. They can be made into flour, or used to make foods such as noodles. Inside the fruit is sap that can be used as glue.
The global spotlight is turning onto jackfruit because experts consider it a viable solution to world hunger. "It's a miracle," says Reddy, "It can provide so many nutrients and calories - everything."

The Miracle Fruit
World
What's big, green, smells funny, has bumpy skin, and grows on trees? It's a jackfruit - and perhaps the solution to world hunger.
Climate change, due to global warming, has destroyed many crops. This means that developing nations don't have enough food to feed their growing populations. Researchers say jackfruit could help replace wheat, corn, and other crops damaged by floods and droughts. Jackfruit is easy to grow. "It survives pests and diseases and high temperatures. It is drought-resistant," says Danielle Nierenberg, president of 'Food Tank', an organization that works on sustainable agriculture.
Experts are excited about all the nutrients jackfruit contains. It's high in protein and vitamins A, B, and C. Other nutrients include calcium and iron. Jackfruit is filling, as well as healthy. "If you just eat 10 or 12 bulbs of this fruit, you don't need food for another half a day," says Shyamala Reddy, a biotechnology researcher at the University of Agricultural Sciences in India.
Jackfruit grows in India and other tropical climates. Jackfruit trees can reach up to 50 feet (15 m), and one jackfruit can weigh anywhere from 10 to 100 pounds (4.5 - 45 kg)! The fruit's light green rind is thick and bumpy. Inside the fruit are seeds surrounded by edible bulbs. One jackfruit can contain up to 500 seeds.
Another benefit of the jackfruit is how versatile it is. Different parts of the tree and fruit can be used in different ways. The fruit's sweet, inner flesh can be eaten raw and tastes similar to pears or mangoes. The flesh can also be dried or roasted, and is found in products such as jams, juices, and ice cream. Jackfruit seeds are useful, too. They can be made into flour or included in processed foods such as noodles. The wood of the tree is used to build furniture and musical instruments. Inside the fruit is sap that can be used as glue. Goats and other farm animals enjoy eating jackfruit leaves.
Although jackfruit has only recently come into the global spotlight, many consider it a viable solution to world hunger. "It's a miracle," says Reddy, "It can provide so many nutrients and calories - everything."





According to the World Health Organization, around 2.4 billion people around the world don't have access to clean water. 'Warka Water' is an invention intended to help solve this water crisis, by providing an alternative water source to people with limited access to water.
Warka Water is a 30-foot-tall tower made of bamboo, mesh, and rope. The materials are all locally produced and sustainable. Warka towers are also portable, and can be easily assembled using simple tools. This makes it ideal for remote, rural areas where people have to walk far from home to find water.
Warka towers were designed to collect and harvest water vapor (dew and fog) and rainfall. Each tower has an outer layer of bamboo tied with ropes. Inside the outer bamboo structure is a layer of plastic mesh. Vapor sticks to the mesh and drips down into a tank where the water is filtered. Each Warka tower can collect up to 100 liters of drinkable water per day.
Arturo Vittori is the Italian architect who invented Warka Water. When he visited Ethiopia's isolated mountain villages in 2012, he saw the water crisis up close for the first time. "Seeing that really affected me," he says. "I decided to think of a way to bring drinking water directly to the villages."
Several things in nature, including plants and insects, inspired Vittori's design for Warka Water. Two inspirations were the namib beetle and spider webs. The namib beetle survives in the desert by collecting fog on its shell. Spider webs catch water from the air. Ethiopian culture was also an influence. Warka Water is named for the warka tree - a fig tree native to Ethiopia. It gives shade and a place for the community to gather. Warka tower also includes a canopy, providing a gathering place for the community.
Warka Water won the 2015-2016 World Design Impact Prize which celebrates designs for social change. Though Warka Water started in Ethiopia, there are already Warka towers in Lebanon and Brazil. In the future, Warka Water plans to build more towers in other countries.

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 2.4 billion people around the world can't get clean water. In many rural areas people have to walk far from home to find water. 'Warka Water' is an invention that can help.
Warka Water is a 30-foot, tower made of bamboo, mesh, and rope. It collects rainwater and vapor from the air. Each structure has an outside layer of bamboo tied with ropes. The inner layer is plastic mesh. Vapor sticks to the mesh and drips down into a tank where the water is filtered. The tower collects up to 100 liters of drinkable water per day. Warka towers are easy to move and put together. The materials used to build the towers are also locally produced and sustainable.
Arturo Vittori, an Italian architect designed Warka Water. On his visit to Ethiopia in 2012, he saw many isolated mountain villages without safe drinking water. He wanted to help these villages.
Warka Warter's design was inspired by several things in nature. For example, the namib beetle collects fog on its shell. The fibers in spider webs were also an inspiration because they catch water from the air. Warka Water is named for the Ethiopian warka tree. Communities come together under the tree for shade. Warka towers also include a canopy for this same purpose.
Warka Water won the 2015-2016 World Design Impact Prize. Though Warka Water started in Ethiopia, there are already Warka towers in Lebanon and Brazil. In the future, the designers plan to build more towers in other countries.

Many people in the world don't have clean water to drink. Now there's something that can help them. It's called 'Warka Water'.
Arturo Vittori, an Italian architect, invented Warka Water. In 2012, he visited villages in Ethiopia. The people there did not have clean water to drink. He decided to help. Vittori named the tower 'Warka' after a special tree in Ethiopia.
Warka Water is a tower. It is 30 feet tall. It's easy to build and carry to different places. People use bamboo, mesh, and rope to build a Warka tower. Warka towers work by taking small drops of water from the air. The water sticks to the mesh. Then, it falls down into a tank at the bottom of the tower. Up to 100 liters of water go into the tank each day. People can then use the clean water.
There are also Warka towers in Lebanon and Brazil. In the future, Warka towers will bring clean water to more countries.




Glasses for Half the World?
World
In today's world, we look at screens all the time - computer screens and TV screens. Screens are everywhere. We spend a lot of time looking at them indoors. We see less sunlight. Many researchers think this is a big problem.
Today, over two billion people in the world have myopia. People with myopia have trouble seeing distant objects. Wearing glasses can help them see things, like road signs that are far away. Studies show there is now a large increase in people with myopia. Researchers say that half of the people in the world will have myopia by 2050.
Researchers want less people to have myopia in the future. They recommend less screen time and more sunlight. It's important to spend less time indoors and more time outdoors. Children should be outside for around three hours each day - even on cloudy days. Being outside helps keep eyes healthy.
Be nice to your eyes - go outside, and enjoy the sunlight.

"We are going down the path of having a myopia epidemic," says Dr. Padmaja Sankaridurg, a researcher in Sydney, Australia. People are always indoors using their electronic devices such as computers and smartphones. This means they are getting less sunlight. Today, over two billion people in the world have myopia (also called nearsightedness). Researchers say that more than 50 percent of the population could be wearing glasses by 2050.
People who have myopia can't see distant objects clearly. However, they can see objects that are closer to them more easily. Some people with myopia develop more serious eye problems. It can also lead to blindness.
Researchers believe the lack of sunlight is causing the myopia "epidemic." For example, many American children play outside for less than 30 minutes each day. One report shows that teenagers in China spend much more time on homework than teenagers in Great Britain and America. They do their homework inside. Children all over the world stay inside using computers and other electronic devices. All this time spent inside means less sunlight.
Children should be outdoors for three hours each day. Being out in the sunlight helps prevent myopia. "We're really trying to give this message now; that children need to spend more time outside," says Kathryn Rose, a researcher in Sydney, Australia.
Doctors believe myopia can be prevented. They recommend children have yearly eye exams. This helps doctors find children with myopia early on, and recommend ways to keep it from getting worse.
So, keep your eyes healthy - go outside, and enjoy the sunlight.

"We are going down the path of having a myopia epidemic," says Dr. Padmaja Sankaridurg, a researcher in Sydney, Australia. There are screens everywhere we look: in homes, at work, at school. People are constantly indoors using their electronic devices, which means they see less sunlight. Today, over two billion people in the world have myopia (nearsightedness) and the number is increasing rapidly. Researchers predict that more than 50 percent of people in the world will be wearing glasses by 2050.
It's hard for people with myopia to see distant objects clearly, while objects that are closer are easier to see. Some people inherit myopia from their parents. However, many children become nearsighted even when their parents are not. There is no permanent cure for myopia. It can be treated with surgery, contact lenses, or glasses. Some myopia can lead to more serious eye problems, including blindness.
Researchers recommend spending more time outdoors and less time indoors looking at screens. Many American children play outside for less than 30 minutes each day. One report showed that teenagers in China spend 14 hours a week on homework indoors - more than double the amount that teenagers in Great Britain and America do. According to more than a dozen studies around the world, the more time children spend outside, even on cloudy days, the less likely they are to get myopia.
So how can this "epidemic" be controlled? Doctors believe there are ways to prevent myopia, as well as make sure people with myopia don't get worse. Firstly, children should have their eyes checked annually. Secondly, children should be outdoors for three hours each day. "We're really trying to give this message now that children need to spend more time outside," says Kathryn Rose, head of orthoptics at the University of Technology, in Sydney, Australia. Another Australian researcher even had the idea of classrooms made of glass so children can get more natural light. These classrooms have transparent walls and ceilings, so light comes in from all directions.
So, keep your eyes healthy - take a break, go outside, and enjoy the sunlight.




Songdo - The City of the Future
World
Songdo, South Korea isn't the first city in the world to be built from scratch. Other modern cities have been built where none existed before. But in this "city of the future," all aspects of life are digitally coordinated.

Many cities use technology to make life easier for their residents. For example, cities often have "hotspots" - Internet in certain areas. But Songdo is different because the city's infrastructure was planned around high-speed Internet and Wi-Fi. This means that people can connect to the Internet anywhere they are. And it's always free! Every smartphone or personal electronic device can access the city's information network. Residents have easy access to all kinds of information (both public and private) including city transportation, medical records, and business information.

Songdo residents can also use their smartphones to control devices in their homes remotely. They can adjust the blinds, set the temperature, and turn on the lights. Residents have a "smart card" ID which opens their front doors. Their televisions are actually special video "telepresence" screens, also connected to the network. Residents use these screens in many different ways. They can make video calls, take a live exercise class, or check their electricity bill - all while sitting on their couch! There is also a health monitoring device in homes so residents can check blood pressure and perform other health checks. The information is automatically recorded in their medical file.

The garbage system in Songdo is one of the first of its kind. There are no garbage trucks, and no trash cans on the street. Instead, an intricate system of tubes sucks garbage underground. These underground tubes are connected to all Songdo homes, apartments, and buildings. The tubes take the garbage to a treatment facility, where it's deodorized and sorted. Food waste is buried in the ground, and most of the remaining waste is recycled. Some of the garbage is even burned for fuel. The system is so technologically advanced that only seven employees handle the garbage for the entire city!
This city of the future isn't finished yet. But Songdo isn't the only "smart city." There is a new trend in building hi-tech cities all over the world!

People who live in Songdo can control the atmosphere in their homes before they arrive. First, they connect to the network with their smartphones. Then, they can adjust the blinds, temperature, and lights in their home. Special video screens in homes are also connected to the network. Residents can use these screens in many different ways. For example, they can make video calls, participate in a live exercise class, or make an appointment with the doctor - all from home!

The garbage system in Songdo is very advanced. Underground tubes take garbage from homes and businesses to a treatment facility. There, the garbage is deodorized and sorted. Food waste is buried, and most of the remaining garbage is recycled or burned for fuel. The system is so efficient that only seven employees work at the facility!

This city of the future isn't finished yet. But Songdo isn't the only "smart city." More and more hi-tech cities are being built all over the world!

World
Technology helps people in their homes and at work. In Songdo, South Korea technology is everywhere. Songdo is the city of the future.

Songdo has Internet all over the city - in homes, in hotels, and on the street. And it's free! People connect to the Internet with their smartphones. In Songdo, people use their smartphones to turn on the lights or the heat in their home. They can do this even when they aren't home.

Songdo doesn't have garbage trucks. People put their garbage in a special bin. Then, tubes take the garbage underground. Computers can see how much garbage people throw away. The computers also help sort the garbage. The computers decide what to recycle and what to burn.

People call Songdo a "smart city." And it's not the only "smart city." Other countries around the world are also building cities like Songdo!





Children's feet grow very fast. Children need new shoes often. They need new shoes about two times a year. Families in poor countries need help buying all those shoes. "The Shoe That Grows" can help.
Kenton Lee invented The Shoe That Grows. Kenton volunteered to help children in Kenya. Many of the children's shoes were too small for their feet. Some children didn't have shoes at all. Without good shoes, children's feet can get hurt. The wounds on their feet can get infected. This can make children very sick. Sick children aren't able to go to school. This makes it hard for these children to succeed.  
Kenton wanted to give durable shoes to these children - but how? He made a shoe that grows as the child grows! The Shoe That Grows comes in two sizes; small and large. Children wear each size for about five years. Now, many children who live in poor countries have comfortable shoes that protect their feet.

Shoes That Grow
World
How often do you buy a new pair of shoes? Children between the ages of three and ten usually need new shoes about twice a year. For families in developing countries this is a problem. They do not have enough money to buy shoes for their children's growing feet. But now, there's an invention that can help. It's called "The Shoe That Grows."
Kenton Lee is the inventor of The Shoe That Grows. Kenton was a volunteer at an orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya. He saw that many of the children were barefoot, or wearing shoes that were too small. Some children had cut out the front of old shoes so they would still "fit." The children's feet were scraped. Wounds sometimes became infected, causing children to get sick. Children need to stay healthy and not miss too much school. With more education they can get better jobs, and they can earn more money for their families. Kenton wanted to give durable shoes to children in need - but how?
Kenton returned from Kenya motivated to find a solution for these children. He designed a special shoe that "grows" with the child. The shoe expands on the top, bottom, and sides. Kenton describes the shoe as "simple and functional." The Shoe That Grows comes in two sizes; small and large. Small is for children between the ages of five and nine. Large is for children between the ages of 10 and 14. Each size should fit for about five years. Thousands of children in countries such as Haiti, Peru, and Ecuador are already wearing The Shoe That Grows. Kenton's invention is really helping these children - one shoe at a time.

Shoes That Grow
World
How often do you buy a new pair of shoes? Children between the ages of three and ten need new shoes about twice a year. Most families who live in developing nations, such as Kenya, cannot afford to buy new shoes for their children's rapidly growing feet. But now, there's a solution -  "The Shoe That Grows."
The Shoe That Grows was invented by Kenton Lee. Kenton had always dreamed of traveling and helping people. So, after college he traveled to Kenya to volunteer. At a Nairobi orphanage, he noticed that many of the children's shoes were too small. Some children had cut out the front of old shoes so they would still "fit." Others walked around barefoot. Kenton was determined to help these children.
Kenton knew that children in developing nations face many challenges in their lives. And he knew that "small things" can make a difference in their health. When children go barefoot, or wear the wrong sized shoes, they can hurt their feet. Wounded feet are susceptible to infection and disease. When children get sick, they may miss many days of school. This can compromise their education and future opportunities.
Kenton wanted to give durable shoes to children in need - but how? After Kenton left Nairobi, he developed the idea of an expandable shoe that could be worn for many years. Eventually, he found a professional shoe designer who made a prototype using his 3D printer. The Shoe That Grows was born!
The Shoe That Grows are sandals made of leather and rubber, and expand in three directions. There are straps on the top and sides that children can adjust to make the sandals fit correctly. Kenton calls his design "simple and functional" and a "common sense innovation." The Shoe That Grows comes in two sizes: small and large. Small is for children between the ages of five and nine, and large is for children between the ages of 10 and 14. Each size should fit a child for about five years.
Thousands of children in countries such as Haiti, Peru, and Ecuador are already wearing The Shoe That Grows. Kenton is really helping these children - one shoe at a time.





Ask a child what they want to be when they grow up, and you'll get a large variety of answers. Some may say they want to be a journalist or a doctor, others a pilot or a chef. What if there was a place where children could experience being a grown-up? Now there is - at KidZania!
KidZania is an indoor theme park where children ages 4-12 can have immersive adventures as they pretend to be
grown-ups. Unlike traditional theme parks, there are no rides or video games. Instead, children dress up like adults and role-play in a miniature city. Adult employees assist children with activities and make sure they stay safe. 
Children begin their KidZania visit through a mock airport terminal. After paying, they get a map and a security bracelet which they must wear until they leave. The bracelet lets parents know that their children are inside the park and sets off an alarm if they try to leave.
Children choose from dozens of jobs, get a uniform, and start working in simulated businesses and trades. As pay, they receive kidZos (KidZania currency). Children can put their salary in a bank account, or use it to buy products and services, like treats or painting classes. The more they work, the more kidZos they accumulate, and the more they experience.
Parents accompanying children to KidZania enjoy watching their children explore. Many parents of older children prefer to relax in the Parents' Lounge. They can drink coffee, watch TV, and use the free Internet while their children have fun.
The first KidZania opened in Mexico in 1999. Today, these unique play spaces can be found in countries such as Japan, Russia, Brazil, and India. More than 25 million people have visited KidZania in locations worldwide.
Child development experts agree that role-playing activities improve a child's ability to focus and develop their thinking skills. However, many feel that older children could benefit more from activities that are creative and less structured than the ones at KidZania. Overall, the tiny customers seem thrilled to be getting a taste of what it's like to be grown-up.

Hackathons
World
Take people who make computer programs. Put them in a room for 24 to 36 hours. Give them computers and caffeine.  Now, what do you have? You have a hackathon!
In a hackathon, people work in groups to create computer projects. They create their projects very quickly.
Normally, computer programs and apps take weeks or months to build. But at hackathons, teams create computer programs and apps in less than two days. Many people work the whole time. They don't even sleep.
There are also special hackathons. There are hackathons for music, and hackathons for science.
Hackathons are also popular at universities. Job recruiters go to university hackathons to find talented students. These students might get jobs at big companies.
At hackathons, people learn new skills. They make new products. They also make new friends. Some hackathon projects earn lots of money. At a hackathon in 2010, a group made a messaging program called GroupMe. In 2011, Skype bought GroupMe for over $50 million dollars!

Hackathons
World
Put hi-tech people in a room together for 24 to36 hours. Give them food, caffeine, and computers, and what do you get? A hackathon!
A hackathon is a gathering of software developers. They work in groups to create new and creative computer projects in a very short amount of time.

"Hackathon" comes from the words "hack" and "marathon." To hack is to solve a problem simply or quickly. A marathon is an activity done intensely for many hours.
Most computer programs and apps take weeks or months to build. But at hackathons, teams create them in less than two days. Many people work the whole time, with no sleep. Others bring sleeping bags so they can take short naps.
"I haven't slept for 36 hours," said Kyle Schei, at a large Hackathon in Las Vegas." But I've only had to think about new things that are fun." He and his team developed JustDrive, a program that helps figure out what distracts drivers.
There are specialized hackathons, too, such as Music Hack Day and Science Hack Day. Hackathons are also becoming popular at universities. They create fun, collaborative environments outside the classroom. Hackathons can help university students find jobs, too. Job recruiters often go to university hackathons to find new talent.
Hackathons are places where new skills are learned, new products are designed, and new friends are made. And you never know how far hackathon ideas can go. GroupMe, a group messaging service, was created at a hackathon in 2010. In August 2011, Skype bought GroupMe for over $50 million dollars!

Hackathons
World
Have you ever created something great in a short amount of time? This is the idea behind Hackathons--a gathering of software developers, designers, and programmers who develop an innovative computer project in just one or two days.
The word "Hackathon" is made up of two different words, "hack" and "marathon." Hack means to solve a problem simply or quickly. A marathon is an activity done intensely for many hours. Most computer programs and apps take weeks or months to build. But at hackathons, teams of tech savvy people come together to create something new and interesting in a short, intense period of time. Most hackathons run for 24 to 36 hours. People often work during the entire hackathon and do not sleep. Some team members bring sleeping bags in order to catch a quick nap.
"I haven't slept for 36 hours, but I've only had to think about new things that are fun," said Kyle Schei at the Las Vegas Hackathon, who worked with his team to develop the program JustDrive which helps determine what distracts drivers.
Hackathons often have a theme. Music Hack Day, started in 2009, is a hackathon for music apps and programs. There's also Science Hack Day. Many hackathons have themes that aim to make the world a better place, such as improving government, health care, and education.
Hackathons are also becoming popular at universities. They create a fun, collaborative environment outside the classroom, where students can learn new skills and technologies. Hackathons can also help university students find jobs. Job recruiters often go to university hackathons to look for new talent. Projects completed during hackathons are also impressive accomplishments to add to a resume.

Elon Musk is a dreamer, inventor, and entrepreneur.  He dreamt of electric cars and sending rockets into space and has made these dreams a reality through his companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX.  His newest dream is to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 35 minutes, a distance that takes almost six hours by car. He plans to make this dream a reality with the Hyperloop, his idea for a fast and inexpensive new way to travel.

The Hyperloop will be a solar-powered, high-speed transportation system that travels up to 1,200 km/h. That's faster than most airplanes! It will look like a futuristic train, but with passengers traveling in pods through a network of tubes.

Building the entire transportation line will cost billions of dollars, but tickets for passengers aim to be affordable at $40 for a round-trip.  The Hyperloop will have passenger and freight pods too. But don't plan on using a bathroom on the Hyperloop. The pods might not have bathrooms, because it will be too dangerous for passengers to walk in the pods while traveling so fast.

Overseeing the development of the Hyperloop is Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), which is run by Dirk Ahlborn.  Ahlborn leads a team of over 100 volunteer engineers, experts, and students from around the word. The team members donate their time, and agree to only get paid after the Hyperloop makes money.  Members of the team are assigned to a work group based on their interests and skills. So far the team is focusing on three main areas: the pods, the stations, and the route.

Ahlborn's main focus is to get the Hyperloop built. "For us, it's mostly about building the Hyperloop, " he said. "We want to see it in the U.S., but if it makes more sense to do that somewhere else, then so be it. The goal is to build it. "

Imagine friends and family, a restaurant, gym, or job that are hours away from home now, will become a short, easy ride on the Hyperloop.  If the Hyperloop becomes a reality of the future, it will forever change how we think of distance.

The Hyperloop
World
Elon Musk is a dreamer and inventor. He dreams of electric cars and sending rockets into space. He made these dreams real with the help of his companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX. His newest dream is to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 35 minutes. That distance takes almost six hours by car. He plans to make this dream real with the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop is Musk's idea for a fast and inexpensive new way to travel.

The Hyperloop will be a high-speed transportation system that travels up to 1,200 km/h. That's faster than most airplanes! Passengers on the Hyperloop will travel in pods through a network of tubes. There will be passenger and freight pods. But don't plan to use the bathroom on the Hyperloop. The pods might not have bathrooms, because it will be too dangerous for passengers to walk in the pod while traveling so fast.

Dirk Ahlborn runs Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), the company developing the Hyperloop. He leads a team of over 100 engineers, experts, and students from around the world. The people on the team donate their time. They agreed to only get paid after the Hyperloop makes money. 

By traveling on the Hyperloop, friends, family, and places that are now hours away from home will only be minutes away. The Hyperloop will forever change how we think of distance.

The Hyperloop will change how we think of distance.  Everything that is now far away from home will be much closer.





Many people are writing in a new language. The language doesn't have words. It only has pictures. The language is called emoji.
Emoji are the small pictures people put in their text messages.  People use emoji to show how they're feeling, or just for fun. There are emoji of people, animals, objects, and symbols.
Shigetaka Kurita created emoji in Japan, in 1999. Emoji became very popular in Japan. Then, in 2011, Apple added emoji characters to the iPhone. And emoji became popular all over the world.
People are using emoji in different ways. Fred Benenson translated the famous book Moby Dick into emoji! He called the book Emoji Dick. Singer Katy Perry translated the words to her song, Roar, into emoji, too.
Linguists are people who study languages. Now, linguists are studying emoji. Linguists say emoji isn't a "real" language. A real language has rules. But emoji doesn't have rules. You can put emoji pictures in any order that you want.
Some people think that emoji will replace writing. But linguist Ben Zimmer doesn't think so. He thinks emoji will just make our writing better.    

Emoji for All of Us
World
There's a new language that everyone seems to be writing. It's the language of emoji. Emoji are the small drawings people add to their texts to express feelings or ideas in a quick way.
You can make your texts more fun with emoji people, animals, objects, and symbols. To ask someone to a movie, you can send emoji of eyes and a movie camera. If you write something as a joke, you can let the reader know by adding a smiley-face.
Emoji were created in 1999, in Japan, and became popular in that country. (Emoji is Japanese for "picture characters.") But in 2011, the computer company, Apple, added the emoji characters to the iPhone. Then, emoji became popular worldwide.
Emoji fan Fred Benenson took the famous book Moby Dick, and translated it into emoji. He called it Emoji Dick. In a Katy Perry music video, the words to the song, Roar, are written in emoji. And if you use the messaging app "Emojli" you'll be able to text your friends only in emoji!
Even linguists are interested in emoji. Linguist Tyler Schnoebelen found that people tend to use the same emoji over and over again. And members of the same social group often use the same emoji, creating their own emoji slang.
Linguists say that emoji is not actually a "real" language. Languages have rules; a sentence only makes sense if it's written a certain way. But emoji have no rules. Users can put the picture characters in any order they choose. They can also use emoji characters to mean whatever they want, which can cause confusion. In one case, people saw two hands together in prayer and thought it was two people high-fiving!
Some people worry that emoji will replace writing. But linguist Ben Zimmer doesn't think so. He thinks emoji will just enrich it.    

Emoji for All of Us
World
A new language is quickly growing and developing. It's called emoji. Emoji are the small drawings people add to their texts, tweets, and other electronic messages, to express emotions and ideas. There are pictures of people, objects, and symbols. To invite someone to a movie, you might text an eyes emoji and a movie camera emoji. If you write a joke, you might add a smiley-face to help the reader know you are not being serious.
Emoji - meaning "picture characters" in Japanese - were created in 1999 in Japan, and became very popular there. But in 2011, Apple added an emoji keyboard to the iPhone, and emoji became an international sensation.
People are even finding new, creative uses for emoji. Fred Benenson, an emoji enthusiast, took the famous book Moby Dick, and translated it into emoji. Singer Katy Perry made a music video in which the lyrics to her song, Roar, are written in emoji. And, a new messaging app called "Emojli" lets you text only in emoji - no words allowed.
Even linguists are showing interest. They study emoji the way they study languages. Linguist Tyler Schnoebelen found that people get into the habit of using the same emoji over and over again. He also learned that people in the same social groups tend to use the same emoji. Schnoebelen compares this to the way slang and accents develop.
So, is emoji a "real" language? Linguists seem to say no. A language has rules, such as how to build sentences. But with emoji, there are no set rules.  People put the different emoji in any order they like. And, a character can mean different things to different people, especially across cultures. The emoji of two palms touching, for example, was designed in Japan, and meant to symbolize prayer. But in the US, many people think it's a picture of two people high-fiving.
For emoji to be a language, it would also need many more characters, to symbolize many more ideas, objects, and emotions. (Even if there were enough characters, imagine trying to find the ones you need!)
So, if you're worried about emoji replacing written language, don't be. As linguist Ben Zimmer said: "I don't see it as a threat to written language, but as enrichment."




Meet India's MOM
World
There's a new spacecraft orbiting Mars. But it wasn't sent by the United States' space agency, NASA, or Russia's RFSA, or Europe's ESA. It was sent by India's space agency, ISRO, the Indian Space and Research Organization.
The spacecraft is called "Mangalyaan" (meaning "Mars Craft" in Hindi). Mangalyaan is part of India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). Mangalyaan began its journey to Mars on November 5, 2013. And it successfully entered Mars' orbit on September 24, 2014. 
ISRO is now the fourth space agency in the world to reach Mars, and the only one to succeed on its first try. This is an amazing accomplishment, especially since nearly two-thirds of the 51 missions sent to Mars have failed.
But ISRO has also broken another record. MOM is the most inexpensive Mars mission in history, with a budget of $73 million. This is less than one-tenth of what NASA has spent on its Mars spacecraft, MAVEN, which arrived at the Red Planet just days before Mangalyaan.
How was India able to keep costs down? "I think the cost of labor is the biggest factor, as well as the complexity of the mission," says David Alexander, director of the Rice Space Institute in Texas.
Since ISRO had such a low budget, it knew that it had to make its spacecraft simple, yet efficient. Mangalyaan has fewer and simpler instruments than MAVEN, but it's designed to target important areas that will complement what NASA and other space agencies are doing.
ISRO says that MOM's main objectives are to demonstrate India's technological capability, look for signs of life, and study the planet's atmosphere. For example, Mangalyaan will search for methane, a gas that may indicate life, in the atmosphere of Mars. The mission is expected to last 6-10 months.
ISRO and NASA are exploring ways to work together on future missions to Mars. The heads of the two space agencies recently met to establish the NASA-ISRO Mars Working Group. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, "This partnership will yield tangible benefits to both our countries and the world."

Meet India's MOM

There's a new spacecraft traveling around Mars. It was sent by India's space agency, ISRO -- Indian Space and Research Organization.
The spacecraft is called "Mangalyaan." (This means "Mars Craft" in Hindi.) And it's part of India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). Mangalyaan was launched on November 5, 2013. It entered Mars' orbit on September 24, 2014. 
India is now the fourth country (or group of countries) to send a spacecraft to Mars. The other three are the United States, Russia, and Europe. And ISRO is the only space agency to get to Mars on its first try. But that's not all. MOM is the cheapest Mars mission in history.
India spent $73 million dollars on MOM. That's only one tenth of what the American Space Agency, NASA just spent on its new Mars spacecraft, MAVEN.
How was ISRO's mission so much cheaper than NASA's? One reason is that the Mangalyaan is very simply made. Mangalyaan has less scientific instruments than MAVEN, but it is very efficient. Mangalyaan uses its instruments to concentrate on important areas of research.
ISRO says that MOM's main goals are to demonstrate India's technological capability, look for signs of life, and study the planet's atmosphere. The mission is expected to last 6-10 months.
ISRO and NASA are exploring ways to work together on future missions to Mars. NASA Administrator, Charles Bolden, said that an India-USA partnership would bring great results to both countries and to the whole world.

The USA, Russia, and Europe have space agencies. Their space agencies are all studying the planet Mars.
India also has a space agency, ISRO (Indian Space and Research Organization). ISRO started its own mission to Mars. The name of its mission is Mars Orbiter Mission, or "MOM."
On November 5, 2013, ISRO sent a spacecraft to Mars. The spacecraft is called Mangalyaan. Mangalyaan means "Mars Ship" in Hindi. Mangalyaan started to orbit Mars on September 24, 2014.
This was an amazing achievement. Many space missions to Mars don't succeed. ISRO was the first space agency to get a spacecraft to Mars the very first time they tried.
MOM is special because it is very cheap. The mission cost $74 million dollars. The US just spent ten times that amount of money on its new Mars spacecraft, MAVEN.
One reason MOM is cheaper is because Mangalyaan is smaller and simpler than MAVEN. But even though Mangalyaan is a simpler spacecraft, it still does complicated work.
ISRO and NASA are planning to work together on future Mars missions.





You don't always need money to "buy" things. In Volos, Greece, many people get things by giving things. They are part of a group called the TEM network . In the TEM network, you barter or trade. For example, if you give someone a haircut, you get a certain number of TEM credits. One credit equals one euro. You can use these credits to "buy" something else, such as eggs or a cooking lesson.

To join the TEM network, you register online. Then you search online for what you want to "buy." You can also advertise what you want to "sell." The network decides how many TEM credits something is worth.

You can trade online or at TEM markets. TEM markets are gatherings where people advertise and trade their products or services. These markets take place at least once a month. TEM markets are a great way for people to meet each other.

Christos Papaioannou helped start TEM. He did it to help people who didn't have enough money to buy basic items. TEM doesn't replace money; people use both TEM and money. TEM helps people in another way, too. It makes people learn how they can help their community.

Bartering is Back
World
You don't always need money to "buy" things. Now, there are "alternative currency systems." In these systems, people "buy" things with their time, talents, and goods. These systems are based on bartering. Bartering, or trading goods, was what people did before money existed.

Christos Papaioannou helped found TEM, an alternative currency system used in Volos, Greece. Residents of Volos use TEM credits to buy everything from a haircut to eggs. TEM was created as a way to help people in Greece, who were finding it more and more difficult to pay for basic needs due to the country's poor financial situation. TEM's goal is not to replace money, but to help people who don't always have enough of it. The TEM network is successful even though it receives no funding from the government.

Participants first register online. Then they can offer or search for what they want to "buy" or "sell." The network decides how many TEMs, or credits, a certain service or product is worth. (One TEM equals one euro.) Everything is recorded online in TEM accounts.

People offer products or services to others, and receive credits in return. They use these credits to "buy" products or services from different people. These exchanges can be made online or at TEM markets. TEM markets are gatherings where people display their products and/or services. The markets are organized regularly, in large, unused buildings. TEM markets are also a great opportunity for people to meet each other.

The TEM experience does more than just help people with financial difficulties. It also helps them realize ways in which they contribute to society.

Bartering is Back
World
What if you could shop for food, get a haircut, or learn to play the piano, without paying any money? Today, there are new -- or actually renewed -- ways of receiving goods and services. They're called "alternative currency systems," and they're a growing trend throughout the world. In such systems, people "buy" things with time, talents, and products, rather than the coins and bills found in their wallets. These systems are based on bartering, the method of trading goods that was used before the development of money.

The community of Volos, Greece, has built a system where residents can buy everything from a massage to eggs using TEM, or "Alternative Local Currency." The TEM network was established as a way to help people in Greece who were suffering from the financial crisis. Without government aid or backing, the TEM system has successfully put people back on their feet. TEM's goal is not to replace the country's currency, but to allow for a "more resilient local economy."

Christos Papaioannou helped found the TEM network. He describes the system as "bartering on steroids." Participants first register online, and then offer or search for different products and services. The network decides how many TEMs, or credits, a certain service or product is worth. (One TEM equals one euro.)  Everything is recorded online in TEM accounts.

People earn credits by offering products or services. Then they use these credits to "buy" products or services from others. These exchanges can be made online or at the TEM market. TEM markets are gatherings where people showcase their wares. They're organized regularly in large, unused buildings. In addition to being a place to trade goods and services, markets are also an opportunity for people to meet, and to appreciate the skills and talents of others. The TEM credit system discourages the accumulation of wealth. TEM's goal is to "spread the wealth" equally, so that everyone benefits.

TEM also offers printed vouchers, similar to checks. People can use these vouchers at participating shops to receive discounts.

The TEM experience does more than give people a way out of their difficult financial situations. It also renews their self-confidence by helping them realize the ways in which they contribute to society.




Backpack Desks
World
When you think of school, what comes to mind? Students sitting at desks? Students walking to school wearing backpacks? Well, for many children in India neither desks nor backpacks are part of their school experience.

Unable to afford backpacks, many of the students carry their books in their arms, or use cheap plastic shopping bags. And when they enter the classroom, they don't sit at desks, or even in chairs. They sit on the hard floor with nothing but their laps to function as tables. This isn't only uncomfortable, but also leads to poor posture, messy handwriting, and problems with eyesight.

Aarambh, a non-profit organization in Mumbai, and DDB Mumbra, a design company, came together to create a solution - Help Desk.

Help Desk is a backpack that doubles as a desk. Made from recycled cardboard boxes, Help Desk can transform from backpack to desk and back again, in just a few seconds. And it only costs 10 Indian Rupees ($0.20 USD).

Not only are Help Desks easy to assemble, they're also easy to produce. The Help Desk design is simply traced onto a cardboard box and cut with a laser.

Before making the final product, children tested it. They checked how easy it was to assemble, and how comfortable it was to wear, carry, and use.

So far, Help Desk has been distributed to six schools in Maharashtra. Over 10,000 students are enjoying the versatility and comfort of their new backpack desks. But the product still has some shortcomings.

Cardboard is not a durable material, and can get ruined in the rain. In addition, the life expectancy of a Help Desk is only about six months and will therefore need replacing twice a year. The company is trying, however, to develop a low-cost plastic coating to help protect Help Desks against moisture and dirt. In the meantime, though, children are benefitting from this simple, yet helpful product.

Backpack Desks
World
For many children in India, going to school means walking a long way. It means learning without the basic comforts of a classroom. Many Indian students do not have backpacks to carry their books. This is because their parents don't have enough money to buy them. Students either carry their books in their arms, or use plastic shopping bags. When they get to school, they don't sit at desks; they sit on the floor. This is bad for students' posture. It also causes problems with eyesight, and messy handwriting.
A non-profit organization called Aarambh, and a design company called DDB Mumbra, came up with a solution - Help Desk. Help Desk is a backpack that can change into a desk and back again in just a few seconds. Help Desks are made from recycled cardboard boxes. And it only costs 10 Indian Rupees ($0.20 USD) to make one.
It's quick and easy to make Help Desks. The special design is traced onto the boxes and cut with a laser. Help Desks were tested by children to make sure it was easy to put together, and comfortable to wear, carry, and use as a desk.
Over 10,000 students in Maharashtra are already using Help Desks. But the product still needs some improvements. Cardboard is not a durable material, and can get ruined in the rain. The lifespan of each Help Desk is therefore only six months to a year. The company is trying to solve this. They are working on making a plastic coating to protect Help Desks against rain. In the meantime, though, Help Desks are already making life easier for thousands of Indian students.

Backpack Desks
World
For many children in India, it's hard to go to school. They don't have enough money to buy backpacks. So they have to carry heavy schoolbooks in their hands or in plastic bags.

In school, there are no desks or chairs. The students have to sit on the floor. This is very uncomfortable. It's also bad for the students' posture and eyesight. Sitting on the floor makes their handwriting messy, too.

Aarambh (an organization) and DDB Mumbra (a design company) thought of a way to help. They made Help Desks. A Help Desk is a backpack that can change into a desk. Then it can change back into a backpack.

The company makes Help Desks from recycled cardboard boxes. It costs them only 10 Indian Rupees ($0.20 USD) to make one. So they cost very little. 

Ten thousand students in Maharashtra are already using and enjoying Help Desks. There's just one problem. Rain can ruin Help Desks, since they're made out of cardboard. So, Help Desks last only about six months. The company is trying to find a way to make Help Desks waterproof. Then students will be able to use their Help Desks for a very long time!




Music of the Future
World
Every year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has a contest. It's a contest to create a new musical instrument. One entry this year was the BubbleSynth by Daniel Novy. The BubbleSynth makes music from bubbles!
The BubbleSynth creates bubbles and keeps track of them. It knows where each bubble goes. It knows how big each bubble is. It knows when each bubble pops. These different qualities make the BubbleSynth play different sounds. A big bubble makes one sound; a small bubble makes another sound.
The BubbleSynth was one of many entries. But there were only three winners. This year, Tolgahan Cogulu won first place. He made an Adjustable Microtonal Guitar. Cogulu took a regular guitar and changed it. He put extra frets on his guitar. Because Cogulu's guitar has so many frets, it can make many more sounds than a regular guitar.
Teenage Engineering won second place. The company made a synthesizer called the OP-1. The OP-1 looks like a small keyboard. It's small enough to take with you. It lets you record, edit, and play electronic music.
Feng Gao won third place. He created the TRI-O. The TRI-O looks a bit like a record player. But it has three spinning discs. Each disc has a peg. A piece of material connects to the pegs to make a triangle. As the discs spin, the triangle changes its size and shape. This makes different musical sounds.
These unusual instruments might make you wonder what music will be like in the future.

Music of the Future
World
Every year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has a contest for new musical instruments. People from all over the world share their designs. This year, 21 out of 80 entrants were chosen as semi-finalists.
Semi-finalist Daniel Novy, from the United States, created the BubbleSynth, which makes music from soap bubbles! The BubbleSynth creates bubbles and tracks them. It identifies where each bubble is, how big it is, and how long it lasts. This information is translated into different sounds. A large bubble, for example, will produce a different tone from a small bubble. A bubble that pops quickly will produce a different pitch from a bubble that lasts longer.
The semi-finalists competed for first, second, and third place. Tolgahan Cogulu, from Istanbul, won first place, with his Adjustable Microtonal Guitar. Cogulu took a classical guitar and changed it, so that it plays a wider variety of sounds. All guitars have frets -- raised lines where you put your fingers to play different notes -- but Cogulu's guitar has special frets. They're movable, so you can add frets and remove frets. This allows the guitar to make more sounds than are usually played in Western music.
Second place went to Swedish company Teenage Engineering, for a synthesizer called the OP-1. The OP-1 looks like a small keyboard. It's a portable music workstation, which lets you record, edit, and play electronic music.
And finally, Feng Gao, from China, won third place with his TRI-O. The TRI-O resembles a record player, but has three spinning discs. Each disc has a peg sticking upward. A material similar to a rubber band is attached to the pegs to make a triangle. As the discs spin, the triangle changes its size and shape. This makes different musical sounds.
Looking at these unique instruments, you might wonder what the future of music will be.

If you'd like to play a musical instrument, why not try your hand at the "BubbleSynth," or strum a few notes on a microtonal guitar? These unique instruments were entries in this year's Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition.
Held at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), the annual competition invites people from all over the world to share their new musical instrument designs. According to the competition's Web site, the event is considered "a hotbed for musicians and artists who are pushing the boundaries of music performance."
Out of 80 entrants, 21 were chosen as semi-finalists. Semi-finalist Daniel Novy, from the United States, invented the BubbleSynth, an instrument that makes music from soap bubbles! The BubbleSynth creates bubbles and tracks them. It identifies where each bubble is, how big it is, and how long it lasts. This information is translated into different sounds. A large bubble, for example, will produce a different tone from a small bubble. A bubble that pops quickly will produce a different pitch from a bubble that lasts longer.
The 21 semi-finalists, who came from five different countries, competed for first, second, and third place. Winners were chosen based on musicality, design, and engineering. (In addition, the audience gave its own, "People's Choice Awards.")
First place went to Tolgahan Cogulu, from Istanbul, for his Adjustable Microtonal Guitar. It was the only non-computerized instrument in the competition. Cogulu altered a classical guitar. While all guitars have frets -- raised lines where you put your fingers to play different notes -- Cogulu's guitar has special frets. They're movable, so you can add frets and remove frets. This allows the guitar to play more notes than are usually played in Western music.
Second place went to Swedish company Teenage Engineering, for a synthesizer called the OP-1. About the size of a small keyboard, the OP-1 is a sleek, portable music workstation. It lets you record, edit, and play electronic music using just one small piece of equipment. The OP-1 has already been featured in a music video by a group called Swedish House Mafia.
Finally, third place went to Feng Gao, from China. He created the TRI-O, an algorithmic MIDI controller. The TRI-O resembles a record player. It consists of three spinning discs; each disc has a peg sticking upward. A stretchable rubber band-like piece is attached to the pegs to form a triangle. As the discs spin, the triangle constantly changes its size and shape, producing different musical sounds. As the triangle transforms, the melody does too.
After viewing the entries to the Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition, you might wonder what the future of music will be.




Fashion That's Making a Difference
Business
When Angela Luna was a senior at Parsons School of Design in New York, she began reading about the many refugees who were suffering hundreds of miles away.  Feeling helpless, she was determined to take action. Luna decided to use her fashion skills to assist the refugees. Armed with creativity and passion to make a change, she designed a line of fashionably functional products. She called her humanitarian fashion start-up ADIFF, which expresses her desire to make ADIFFerence in the lives of refugees and other populations in need.

ADIFF designs versatile products to equip people for various weather conditions and environments. "While researching the refugee crisis," explains Luna, "I noticed numerous daily issues faced by refugees that could be addressed through design." In response, Luna created a series of garments aimed at providing shelter, safety, comfort, and security to people on the go. This includes jackets that transform into tents, backpacks, sleeping bags, and flotation devices. All of Luna's jackets are one size and gender neutral, making distribution to populations in need quick and easy.

Luna's flagship product, which has already been funded on Kickstarter, is the Reflective Reversible Jacket.  Luna saw how reflective clothing could save lives by making people visible in the dark. She also saw the need for just the opposite - to keep people from standing out. That was the impetus for the Reflective Reversible Jacket. Its tagline reads: "Reflective on one side, camouflaging green on the other: choose when you want to be seen."

Although Luna's products were inspired by refugees, they are designed to fit the needs of anyone looking for good quality waterproof gear for hiking, camping, biking, or even strolling in the city. For every jacket bought, one is donated to a refugee.

The future looks promising for Luna and her fashion start-up, ADIFF. Luna was the recipient of the 2016 Womenswear Designer of the Year award. And her socially conscious designs have won global recognition. "I remain steadfast in the belief that fashion or any other industry can become a movement for change," says Luna. "All it takes is a new approach to an old problem."

How can fashion help refugees? Fashion design student Angela Luna found a way. She started a company that makes special jackets. These jackets turn into tents, backpacks, sleeping bags, and flotation devices. They are designed to protect refugees from harsh weather.

Luna calls her fashion company ADIFF. The name expresses her wish to make ADIFFerence in the lives of refugees and other populations in need. Luna's products aim to "provide shelter, safety, comfort, security, and other things to people on the go." All of Luna's jackets are one size and designed to fit both men and women.

Luna's first product, funded on Kickstarter, was the Reflective Reversible Jacket. Luna realized that reflective clothing - which makes people visible in the dark - could save lives. But she also realized that sometimes it's important not to be seen. In response, she created the Reflective Reversible Jacket. When you wear it one way, the reflective side shows. When you wear it the other way, the non-reflective side shows.

Although Luna's products were inspired by refugees, they are designed to protect anyone from the elements. ADIFF's waterproof gear can be used for hiking, camping, biking, or even walking around the city. For every jacket bought, one is donated to a refugee.

Luna's success is growing. She has already received the 2016 Womenswear Designer of the Year award. "I remain steadfast in the belief that fashion or any other industry can become a movement for change," says Luna. "All it takes is a new approach to an old problem."

One of Luna's first products was the Reflective Reversible Jacket. One side of the jacket is reflective. When the reflective side is showing, people can see you in the dark. This helps keep you safe. When you don't need people to see you, you can wear the jacket inside out.
 
All of Luna's jackets come in one size. When you buy a Jacket, Luna's company donates a jacket to a refugee. Luna calls her company ADIFF. That's because she wants to make ADIFFerence in the lives of refugees.

'Wayfair', an online furniture store, has its own AR app. You choose a piece of furniture from the company's catalogue, and the item appears on your device's screen. Then, you point the device at a room in your home. It looks as if the item is in the room! You can even move the item around the room, to see where it looks best.
'Wikitude' is another AR app. It gives you information about any location that you point your phone at. Point your phone at a restaurant, and Wikitude will show you their menu and hours, so you don't have to go inside.
Today, more and more businesses are making their own apps that people can download. So, choose one today, and start improving your retail experience.

Augmented Reality
Business
How do you choose a restaurant in an unfamiliar city? Which furniture fits best in your living room? Augmented reality (AR) can help you answer these questions, and more!
AR uses digital elements to enhance real world experiences. It merges digital pictures and information with the real world - when you look at it through the screen of an electronic device. For example, with an AR app called 'Wikitude', you point your phone at a location, such as a restaurant, and the restaurant's opening hours, menu, and reviews will appear on the screen.
To use AR, you need an electronic device, such as a smartphone or tablet (with a camera and GPS), an Internet connection, and an AR app. There are many kinds of AR apps - for gaming, education, business, and more.
Retailers are creating their own AR apps, to make online shopping easier for customers. Normally, when you shop online, you can't try on an article of clothing or pair of glasses. But now, with certain AR apps you can take a picture of yourself with your device and see an image of you "wearing" the glasses or article of clothing. Some AR apps even let you "try on" makeup. While it's not the same as actually trying on the items, it's the next best thing.
'Wayfair', an online furniture retailer, has an AR app that lets you see how a piece of furniture will look in your home. You choose a picture from Wayfair's catalogue, and it appears on the screen of your device. Then, you point your device at a room in your home and it looks as if the piece of furniture is in the room. You can use the touch screen to place the item in different areas of the room, to see where it looks best. These types of AR apps help customers feel more confident about their purchases. They may also reduce the number of items being returned to online stores by unsatisfied customers.
Regarding AR's future, Andy Gstoll, Wikitude's chief marketing officer says, "Imagine if people could point their phones ... at everything and everyone around them to get more valuable information on what they see."




Have Your Soup and Eat the Spoon, Too
Business
Imagine finishing a delicious meal - then eating your spoon for dessert! Narayana Peesapaty thinks that sounds like a great idea. India uses the most disposable cutlery of any country in the world - throwing out over 120 billion pieces per year. Peesapaty, an Indian researcher and agriculture consultant, was looking for an alternative to plastic cutlery, which is bad for the environment and for health. So he invented edible cutlery! He founded the company 'Bakeys' in 2010 to bring his invention to people all over the world.
Peesapaty got the idea for edible cutlery when he noticed people using flatbread to scoop up their food. He began thinking about environmentally friendly cutlery made from natural ingredients. There were already some types of compostable cutlery available - for example, some made from corn. However, Peesapaty believes his cutlery is better. You can eat his cutlery after use. Or, if you decide to throw your edible cutlery away instead of eating it, it takes much less time to biodegrade than corn cutlery.
The edible cutlery is made from millet, rice, and wheat flours. After the dough is prepared, and molded into spoon shapes, it's baked in machines. The cutlery comes out hard and crunchy. It's nutritious and completely vegan. Spoons can be used with hot liquids, as they only begin to soften after 10 minutes. The cutlery comes in three types - plain, lightly sweetened, and savory (with spices including salt and pepper). Each category has various flavors. Customers can also order customized cutlery with different colors or flavors. The shelf-life of the cutlery is about two years in an unopened package.
Peesapaty believes a business can help the environment and still make money. An important part of Peesapaty's business model is the edible cutlery's main ingredient, millet. Millet needs less water to grow than rice. Peesapaty hopes his product will create a market for farmers to grow more millet. Eventually, he wants to buy ingredients directly from the farmers. This will help make edible cutlery as affordable as plastic.
Peesapaty's mission is to start a "cutlery revolution." "Our day is full of plastic right from the start to the end," says Peesapaty. He hopes to change that.

Imagine finishing a delicious meal - then eating your spoon for dessert! Narayana Peesapaty thinks that's a great idea. Peesapaty was concerned about how much plastic cutlery was being used in his country, India. Plastic cutlery is bad for the environment and for health. So he invented an alternative - "edible cutlery!" 
Peesapaty's cutlery is made from millet, rice, and wheat flours. The dough is shaped into spoons, then baked in machines. The spoons come out hard and crunchy. Edible cutlery can even be used with hot drinks; they only begin to get soft after 10 minutes. The spoons come in three types - plain, sweet, and savory. Customers can also customize their cutlery by ordering spoons with special colors or flavors.
But you don't have to eat the spoons; you can throw them away. Edible cutlery biodegrades within just four to five days. They're also suitable for vegans, and contain only healthy ingredients. Edible cutlery lasts for about two years in an unopened package.
Peesapaty believes his business can help the environment and make money. His mission is to start a "cutlery revolution." The main ingredient in edible cutlery is millet, which needs less water to grow than rice. Peesapaty hopes his product will encourage farmers to grow more millet. This way, he'll be able to buy the millet directly from farmers, and sell his cutlery for the same price as plastic cutlery.
Peesapaty's company is growing. Soon they'll be making edible chopsticks and forks. They also plan to make cups and plates. Peesapaty hopes his invention will one day replace plastic cutlery completely.

Have Your Soup and Eat the Spoon, Too
Business
When you finish your soup, don 't wash your spoon. Eat it! Narayana Peesapaty, a researcher in India, is worried about all the plastic cutlery people use and throw away. He says plastic is bad for the environment and not healthy for people. So Peesapaty invented spoons you can eat. He calls them "edible cutlery."
To make the edible cutlery, workers use flours from different grains to make dough. Then, they cut the dough into spoon shapes. Finally, they bake the cutlery in a machine. The cutlery is hard, and ready to use. It can even be used in hot drinks; the spoons don 't melt. People can decide if they want cutlery with a sweet or savory taste - or no taste at all. They are even healthy to eat. The spoons can last for two years inside the package.
Peesapaty wants his cutlery to be as cheap as plastic cutlery, so people will stop using plastic. He is planning to make other edible cutlery, too. He will make forks and chopsticks next. Soon we may be eating our cups and plates, too!




Open Offices: Helping or Hurting?
Business
About 70 percent of offices in the United States are open offices. An open office is a large room with many tables. All the workers sit together at the tables. Some workers like open offices - but many don't.
What is good about open offices? People can ask their co-workers for help at any time. Open offices are also good for group projects because everyone is sitting together.
Not everyone likes open offices. Some people think there isn't enough privacy. In an open office, workers often have conversations. This makes a lot of noise. Many people don't work well with a lot of noise. Also, when one person gets sick in an open office - watch out! Germs move from one person to the next very quickly.
Lindsey Kaufman works in an open office, but doesn't like it very much. She says that she works best when no one else is around. There are good things and bad things about working in an open office.
What do you think?

Open Offices: Helping or Hurting?
Business
In 2012, Facebook, a social networking website, shared its plan to build the largest open office in the world. Their plan surprised many people who weren't sure that open offices were a good idea. However, today about 70 percent of offices in the United States are considered open offices.
In open offices there are few (or no) walls, so employees interact more often - and less formally. Usually, employees sit at tables in "neighborhoods," according to the teams they work with. This allows employees to communicate instantly with the people in their team. When Michael Bloomberg was mayor of New York City, he and his staff sat together in an open office. Bloomberg believes working in an open office increases cooperation and respect among employees.
What are the disadvantages of an open office? There are three main issues: privacy, noise, and health. There are no doors to close for privacy in an open office, so there can be many interruptions and distractions. Employees must use headphones or signs to show co-workers that they don't wish to be disturbed. Noise can also be a big problem. An article in the magazine Scientific American, said that background noise makes it difficult for people to focus. When people can't focus, they're less productive at their job.
 
People also get sick more often in open offices. Sitting close together means germs spread more easily. Lindsey Kaufman, who works in an advertising agency, said that one flu season took down the co-workers in her open office "like dominoes."
While there are advantages to both types of offices, the open office seems to be the more popular choice for now. Just ask Facebook!

Open Offices: Helping or Hurting?
Business
In 2012, the social networking website, Facebook, shared its plan to build the largest open office in the world. Open offices are not a new trend. The idea has been around since the 1950s. Today, about 70 percent of offices in the United States have no or low partitions. However, Facebook's plan surprised many people who feel that open offices aren't the best type of office arrangement.
Since there are few (or no) walls, employees in an open office interact more often. Their face-to-face meetings are less formal, and their collaborations more spontaneous. Often, employees sit at the tables in "neighborhoods," according to department. This makes co-workers more accessible to each other throughout their workday. When Michael Bloomberg was mayor of New York City, he and his staff sat together in an open office. "It promotes cooperation," he said. "People also want to feel included, and everybody wants recognition and respect."
What are the drawbacks to working in an open office? There are three main issues: privacy, noise, and health. Most people value privacy. In an open office there are few or no doors, so employees cannot control when they are accessible to their co-workers. It's also difficult to have a private conversation, without the entire department hearing it! Employees must use headphones, signs, or other visual cues to show co-workers that they do not want to be interrupted. Headphones can sometimes be helpful in reducing background noise, however it's not always enough. An article in the magazine Scientific American, said that background noise makes it difficult for people to focus. When people can't focus, they're less productive as well.
Another drawback of open offices is that sitting close together means germs spread more easily among employees. Researchers in Denmark found that the more people there are working in a single room (as in an open office), the more sick leave they take. Lindsey Kaufman, who works in an advertising agency, said that one flu season took down the co-workers in her open office "like dominoes."
While there are advantages to both types of offices, the open office seems to be the more popular choice for now. Just ask Facebook!





People in the fashion industry realize the importance of protecting the environment and conserving natural resources. Scientists and fashion designers have already begun making eco-friendly clothing. Now, they're taking it a step further. The future of fashion could be in your kitchen! Fabric from wine, milk, and recycled coffee beans can be created in a lab, and turned into clothing. One of the most eco-friendly materials being used today is made from tea.
Fashion designer Suzanne Lee was one of the first people to start designing clothes from kombucha- a fermented tea. The process requires very little water, no chemicals, and only natural dyes. When you add yeast, sugar, and bacteria to the tea, it creates cellulose. Cellulose is the basis of all natural fabrics. With kombucha fabric, fibers are grown by a microbe instead of a plant. Lee learned that you can make fabric thinner or thicker, according to how long you leave it growing. She has designed coats, skirts, and shoes from kombucha fabric. Lee thinks the fabric looks "a bit like human skin."
Sacha Laurin also creates clothing and jewelry from kombucha fabric. Her "kombucha couture" is actually alive! It takes Laurin about one week to grow enough fabric for one dress. Each piece is one-of-a-kind. Laurin's kombucha clothing is available online from $500 to $1,000.
Some people are unsure about these new types of fabric because right now there isn't a way to make large amounts of fabric at once. Also, clothing made from biomaterials is still very expensive. Moisture is a problem for kombucha fabric. When the fabric absorbs liquids like water and sweat, it gets heavy and the clothing falls apart. According to Lee, those who want eco-friendly clothes will still be attracted to this new style because "it's not just biodegradable, it's compostable." Kombucha clothing can be recycled naturally after being worn, because it's made of living cellulose. Lee imagines a day when people will throw away used clothes "like vegetable peelings." Additionally, the clothing is edible!
What do you think? What other delicious futuristic "fabric" ideas could scientists find in the kitchen?

Many people in the fashion industry understand the importance of protecting the environment and our natural resources. Making fabric uses a lot of natural resources. It's important to find new ways of making fabric that use less natural resources. Scientists and fashion designers have already begun making eco-friendly clothing.
Now, the future of eco-friendly fashion could be in your kitchen! For example, fabric from milk and used coffee beans can be created in a lab, and turned into clothing. One of the most eco-friendly fabrics being used today is made from kombucha - a fermented tea.
Making kombucha fabric uses very little water, no chemicals, and only natural dyes. When you add yeast, sugar, and bacteria to the tea, it creates cellulose. Cellulose is the basis of all natural fabrics. Suzanne Lee was one of the first people to start designing kombucha clothes.
Sacha Laurin creates clothing and jewelry from kombucha fabric. It takes Laurin about one week to grow enough fabric for one dress. Right now, there isn't a way to make large amounts of kombucha fabric at once. Another problem is that water ruins kombucha fabric. Clothing made from biomaterials is also very expensive. Laurin sells her kombucha clothing designs for $500 to $1,000. But those who want eco-friendly clothes are interested because "it's not just biodegradable, it's compostable" as Lee says. This means that kombucha clothing can be recycled naturally after being worn, because it's made of living cellulose. It can also be eaten!

What do you need to make clothing? Fabric. Making fabric uses a lot of water and energy. This can hurt the environment. Some scientists are looking for new ways to make fabric that won't hurt the environment.
In their labs, scientists can make fabric from coffee, milk - even tea. How do they make fabric from tea? First, they make a special tea called kombucha. Then, they add sugar to the hot tea. When the tea is cool, they put it in a tub. Then, they add some vinegar and bacteria. The fabric grows from the mixture inside the tub. After the fabric dries, you can use it to make clothing.
Sacha Laurin is a fashion designer. She uses kombucha fabric to make clothes and jewelry. Different color teas change the color of the fabric. You can even eat Laurin's clothes, if you want. But don't wear them in the rain. Kombucha clothes can get very heavy when wet.

Many people work in an office. They sit at the same desk every day. They see the same people. Some people think this is boring. They want adventure. Many of these people become "digital nomads."
Digital nomads travel with their computer from place to place. They need fast Internet. Fast Internet is important because digital nomads work online. But it is lonely sometimes. That's why many digital nomads work at "co-working spaces." At co-working spaces, workers use the fast Internet. They sit with other people. But they do their own work. Yet workers also help each other. There are co-working spaces all over the world. Indonesia has an interesting co-working space. It's called "Hubud."
Hubud is on an island in the middle of the ocean. It's on the island of Bali. Hubud has bamboo walls. When you sit in Hubud, you can see rice fields and palm trees.  Hubud is a relaxing place to work. It is so relaxing, that many workers come to Hubud in their bare feet!

Working the Dream - at Hubud
Business
Today, many people work as freelancers or run their own small businesses. And many of these freelancers and small business owners work by themselves. However, working alone can make them feel isolated, so many have begun "co-working." Co-working offices are full of people working, but not all for the same company. Everyone is doing his or her own work.
Workers pay a membership fee for a desk and access to high-speed Internet. They also have use of office equipment, such as printers and scanners. And they get as much coffee as they want. Co-working spaces are usually found in large cities. But one co-working space, called "Hubud," is in a very different kind of place - on an island in the middle of the ocean.
Hubud is located in Ubud, Bali. It has the usual comforts of a co-working space, but the atmosphere is different. Hubud's bamboo building is surrounded by beautiful views of rice fields and palm trees. Many co-working spaces can feel formal and serious, but Hubud has a relaxed atmosphere. Many people even work in their bare feet! Hubud's outdoor cafe serves organic food and drinks.
Many of the workers at Hubud are "digital nomads." Digital nomads are people who work online using computer technology, so they don't need one physical workplace. Digital nomads can work anywhere in the world, as long as there is a fast Internet connection. For many, a backpack and a laptop is all they need to be able to work. Traveling and sightseeing is as important to them as earning a salary.
At Hubud, people enjoy learning from each other, and often end up working together on projects. Hubud also offers courses for digital nomads, and people interested in becoming digital nomads. As co-founder Peter Wall says, "People come to Hubud for the Internet; they stay for the community."

Working the Dream - at Hubud
Business
You may have heard about the popular style of work called "co-working." In co-working offices people work, but not all for the same company. Most workers are self-employed or starting their own small businesses. After paying a membership fee, independent "co-workers" get desks to work at. They also get access to high-speed Internet, conference rooms, office equipment - and unlimited coffee. Many people feel less lonely at co-working spaces than they do at home offices or cafes. There are more than 2,000 co-working spaces worldwide, mostly in large cities. But one co-working space, Hubud, is in an unlikely spot - on an island in the middle of the ocean.
Hubud is in the town of Ubud, on the island of Bali. It provides the same amenities as other co-working spaces. But Hubud's atmosphere is different. The Hubud building is made of bamboo and wood, and is surrounded by beautiful green rice fields and palm trees. People relax in Hubud's outdoor garden cafe, which serves organic food and drinks. And the beach is only 20 minutes away. Down the road is Ubud's Monkey Forest, whose residents often "swing by" for a visit! Hubud provides such a relaxed atmosphere, that many people work at Hubud in their bare feet!
Ninety percent of Hubud's members consider themselves "digital nomads" - workers who aren't tied down to one physical workplace. Digital nomads can work anywhere in the world, as long as there is a reliable Internet connection. This lifestyle is becoming more popular, especially with young people who want more flexibility to travel. Digital nomads take advantage of being able to work anywhere, by traveling everywhere. "There are so many people working on fascinating projects," says Nicole, an entrepreneur, "but it's lonely when you're traveling and doing that independently."
At many co-working spaces people work on their computers and ignore the other people around them. At Hubud, people learn from each other, and often end up working together on projects. Hubud encourages this atmosphere by offering courses aimed at digital nomads. As co-founder Peter Wall says, "People come to Hubud for the Internet; they stay for the community."





Look...up in the sky! It's a camera. It's a delivery service. It's a drone!
A drone is a flying robot. It's also called an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Some drones are flown using remote control, others are programmed to fly on their own. Drones can be as big as an airplane or as small as a flying disc.
For years, drones have been flown out of the public eye. They've been used by the military as a way to carry out missions without putting pilots' lives in danger. They've also been used to help people; they fight fires, do search and rescue missions, and study the weather. For example, drones can be flown into a hurricane to measure how strong it is.
But now, with drone technology improving and the cost of drones falling, UAVs are starting to be used for commercial purposes. In 2013, Amazon, the online shopping company, suggested using drones to deliver packages to customers. Since then, many other businesses have found commercial uses for drones.
 
Game of Drones is a company that develops drone-building kits. You can build your own drone and use it in competitions in which you knock your opponent's drone out of the sky.
Some drones are actually flying cameras. The HEXO+ drone can follow you wherever you go and film you doing different activities. It's also great for making movies because it can film a scene from any viewpoint.
 
News companies are using drones to gather and report news. Ad companies are using them for advertising.
But even though there are countless ways to use drones in business, commercial drones aren't filling the skies just yet. Outside the U.S., commercial drones have just started to get off the ground. In the U.S., there are strict rules regarding the use of commercial drones, due to safety and privacy issues. In fact, some U.S. companies are moving their businesses to Europe, where laws are less strict.
U.S. laws are expected to become more relaxed, however, as the drone industry continues to develop and collision-avoidance technology improves. And when it does, there's no telling where commercial drones will take us.

Recently, drones have become less expensive, so they're starting to be used for commercial purposes. In 2013, Amazon, the online shopping company, thought of using drones to deliver packages quickly. Since then, other businesses have thought of different commercial uses for drones.
 
Some companies make drones for fun. There are competitions where you try to knock your friend's drone out of the sky. Some drones have cameras. The HEXO+ drone can follow you wherever you go and film you doing sports and other activities. You can also use drones to film movies.
Some companies are using drones to gather and report news. Other companies are using them for advertising.

Do you want a drone? A drone is a flying robot. It flies without a pilot inside. You can fly drones by remote control. You can also make drones fly by themselves.
 
At first, only armies used drones. They sent the drones on dangerous missions. Then, groups started to use drones to help civilians. They used drones to help people in danger, and to study the weather.
Now, companies are making drones for business. Amazon, the online shopping company, thought of the idea first. Amazon decided to use drones to send packages.
Some companies put cameras on drones. These drones follow you wherever you go and film you doing activities. There are also drones that report news and drones that advertise products.
The U.S. has strict rules about flying drones. But these rules will probably become less strict over time. We'll just have to wait and see where business drones take us.





SURFSET is an exercise program that makes you feel like you're surfing. You exercise on a surfing machine called the RipSurfer X. The exercises you do are real surfing moves.
The RipSurfer X is a surfboard on top of a rubber bag. The rubber bag has air inside. This makes the surfboard wobble, so it's hard to balance.
Mike Hartwick thought of the idea. He wanted to surf indoors, so he put his surfboard on an inner tube. Hartwick and his friend, Bill Ninteau, exercised on the device. Fitness trainer Sarah Ponn helped them think of exercises to do. Then, the three of them started a business. They called it SURFSET.
Newspapers and magazines wrote about the new company. New Yorkers waited in line to try the workout.
The TV show Shark Tank helped SURFSET the most. On Shark Tank, you ask business people ("sharks") to invest in your company. When SURFSET went on the show, a shark invested $300K.

There are SURFSET classes in the US, Singapore, Chile, Austria, Serbia, and other countries. SURFSET won't give you the ocean, but it'll give you a great workout!

SURFSET
Business
Gyms are more exciting than ever, with classes such as Zumba and CrossFit. And now, there's SURFSET.
SURFSET is an exercise program that simulates surfing. It does this by using indoor surfing machines and exercises based on surfing moves. One move is the "pop-up," where you quickly switch from a lying position to a standing position.
The surfing machine is called the "RipSurfer X." It's a surfboard on rubber tubes filled with air. The tubes make the board unsteady, like a surfboard on water. SURFSET works to improve balance, core strength, cardiovascular health, flexibility, and power.
Mike Hartwick made the first RipSurfer X. He spent his summers surfing in California. But then he got an office job in Boston, far from California's ocean. He missed surfing, but he figured out a way he could still get a surfing workout.
Hartwick put his surfboard on an inner tube filled with air. He and his friend, Bill Ninteau, brought the contraption to a gym to "surf." Sarah Ponn, a fitness trainer at the gym, helped them create workouts using the board. The three decided to start a business - SURFSET.
At first, they made prototypes of the RipSurfer X and brought them to different US cities. New Yorkers lined up to try them. Newspapers and magazines wrote articles about the new company.
But SURSFET's biggest break came when they went on Shark Tank. It's a TV show where participants try to get investors (called "sharks") to invest in their businesses. SURFSET succeeded in getting a shark to invest $300K.
Today, there are SURFSET classes in the US, Canada, Australia, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Chile, Austria, and Serbia, with more on the way. SURFSET won't give you the ocean, but it will give you a great workout!

Business
Gyms are getting more and more interesting these days, with activities such as CrossFit and Zumba. And now, there's SURFSET.
SURFSET is surfing minus the water. In a SURFSET training class, you work out on a special surfboard, called the RipSurfer X. The board sits on rubber tubes filled with air, which make the board unsteady, like a surfboard on water.
The SURFSET workout includes surfing-inspired moves, such as paddling out (lying face down on the board and paddling with your arms to move across the water), the pop-up (moving from a lying position to a standing position), and duck diving (pushing your board under a wave). SURFSET works on balance, core strength, cardiovascular strength, flexibility, and power. Like Pilates and yoga, SURFSET works your entire body. And by keeping your balance while performing the moves, you're strengthening your body even more.
The RipSurfer X was invented by Mike Hartwick, a former professional hockey player, who spent his summers surfing in California. After retiring from hockey, Hartwick worked in finance in Boston, far from California's beaches.
Hartwick missed surfing and the workout it gave him. So he placed his surfboard on an inner tube - a round rubber tube filled with air - to simulate the movement of a surfboard. Hartwick and hockey player friend, Bill Ninteau, took the indoor surfboard to the gym to try out different moves. Sarah Ponn, a fitness trainer at the gym, helped Hartwick and Ninteau develop workout routines for the board. Eventually, the three decided to start a business - SURFSET Fitness.
The team built models of the RipSurfer X, and brought them to various cities in the US. Their biggest success was in New York, where people lined up to try out the board. SURFSET also got media attention, including a write-up in "The Wall Street Journal," a well-known business newspaper.
But what really helped SURFSET was the TV show Shark Tank, where entrepreneurs try to persuade investors (called "sharks") to invest in their businesses. The team went on the show and "wowed" the sharks. Shark Mark Cuban ended up investing $300K in the company.

Today, there are SURFSET classes in the US, Canada, Australia, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Chile, Austria, and Serbia, with more on the way. You'll find SURFSET classes in gyms and in official SURFSET studios.
 
With SURFSET, you won't get the ocean, but you'll get an extreme workout!




Take Your Parents to Work Day
Business
You may have heard of "Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day," a day for children to visit their parents at work. But have you ever heard of "Take Your Parents to Work Day?" It's a day for parents to visit their adult children at work.
On this day, created by Google in 2012, parents participate in workshops. They tour Google's offices, and watch their sons and daughters in action.
The reason? Many employees are in their 20s and early 30s. They do high-tech jobs that didn't exist five or ten years ago, so many of their parents don't understand what they do all day. Take Your Parents to Work Day is intended to bridge this generation gap, and help parents understand what their "kids" actually do for a living.
People born between 1981 and the early 2000s are part of a generation called "millennials." Studies show that millennials have closer relationships with their parents than earlier generations. And their parents tend to be very (some say "overly") involved in their children's lives. This is true in North America, South America, and Asia.
Millennials seek their parents' advice and approval when making decisions. Some millennials even bring their parents to job interviews. Take Your Parents to Work Day was created in response to this reality.
Michael Van Grinsven, of the financial firm Northwestern Mutual, says parents influence their children's career decisions. By visiting the company, parents feel more connected to it, and are more likely to encourage their children to stay with the company.
Danielle Restivo, of the professional networking site LinkedIn, says that employees who have their parents' approval are happier workers. LinkedIn followed Google's lead by hosting a "Bring in Your Parents Day." It was the result of a request made by Restivo's own mother. Restivo's mother asked her to write a summary of her job, so she'd know how to explain it to friends.
Hector Hernandez, a 31-year-old LinkedIn employee, says his parents wish he'd chosen a "traditional" profession, such as medicine or law, and they try to convince him to change careers. After taking part in Bring in Your Parents Day, however, Hernandez hopes his parents will start appreciating what he does.
Deutsche Bank, Logitech, and other companies are instituting parents' days too. But not all companies think it's a good idea. They say employees need to be mature, confident, and able to make their own decisions. They say that involving parents in the workplace keeps an entire generation from growing up.

There's a new day on the company calendar. It's called "Take Your Parents to Work Day." It's a day for parents to visit their adult children at work. Google introduced the day in 2012.
The reason? Many Google employees are in their 20s and early 30s. They're doing high-tech jobs that didn't even exist 10 years ago. As a result, many parents don't understand what their children do. Google's Take Your Parents to Work Day helps solve this problem.
On Take Your Parents to Work Day, parents participate in workshops. They learn about the company, tour Google offices, and see what their sons and daughters do each day.
People born between 1981 and the early 2000s are part of the "millennial generation." People of this generation are called "millennials." According to studies, millennials are closer to their parents than are other generations. Their parents are very involved in their lives. This is true in North America, South America, and Asia.
Millennials want their parents' advice and approval when making decisions. Some even bring their parents to job interviews. Google believes that by letting parents visit their offices, the parents will feel connected to the company. They are also more likely to encourage their children to stay with the company.
Danielle Restivo, of the networking site LinkedIn, says employees who have their parents' approval are happier workers. Restivo helped create a parents' day for LinkedIn, called "Bring in Your Parents Day."  
Hector Hernandez, a 31-year-old LinkedIn employee, says his parents have been asking him to change his career. They want him to become a doctor, lawyer, or something else they understand. After attending "Bring in Your Parents Day," however, Hernandez hopes his parents will change their minds about what he does.
While other companies, such as Logitech and Deutsche Bank, are also having parents' days, some companies think it's a bad idea. They say employees should be mature, and able to make their own decisions. They say that involving parents in the workplace keeps millennials from growing up.

Google has "Take Your Parents to Work Day." On this day, parents visit their adult children at work. They take workshops to learn about Google. They see what their "kids" do at work. They take a tour of the company, and have lunch in a company cafe.
Many Google employees are in their 20s. They do high-tech jobs. Many of their parents don't understand these jobs.
Workers in their 20s like to get their parents' advice and support when they make decisions. But it's hard for parents to support something they don't understand.
Hector Hernandez is 31-years-old. He works at the company LinkedIn. Hernandez says his parents don't approve of his job because they don't "get it." They want him to be a doctor or lawyer, or to choose another profession they understand.
When parents visit their children at work, they feel a connection to the company. If they like the company, they encourage their children to keep working there.
Other companies followed Google. They made their own parents' days. LinkedIn has "Bring in Your Parents Day."
Danielle Restivo also works at LinkedIn. She says workers are happier when their parents approve of their jobs. Hector Hernandez hopes Bring in Your Parents Day will help his parents feel good about what he does.
But some companies don't want parents at work. They say workers in their 20s need to be independent. They need to make their own decisions.




Food Mash-ups
Business
There are fashion trends and music trends. And now there are even food trends. A popular food trend today is the food mash-up. A food mash-up is a mix of two or more foods that don't usually go together. An example is the waffle taco.  It's a sweet waffle with meat and eggs inside.
What started this trend? Many say it was the Cronut. The Cronut is a cross between a croissant and a donut. French pastry chef Dominique Ansel created it. The outside of a Cronut is crispy and sugary. The inside is flaky, has layers, and has a cream filling.
A few hundred people wait in line outside Ansel's New York bakery before it opens. They want to make sure they get a Cronut before the bakery runs out of them. Cronuts are so popular that some people wait in line to buy the $5 Cronut. Then they sell it for $50!
Other food establishments are creating their own food mash-ups. There's the ramen burger, a hamburger in a "bun" of fried ramen noodles. There's the kimchi quesadilla, a Korean-Mexican creation. You'll find it at the Kogi Korean BBQ food truck, in Los Angeles.
In fact, there are food mash-ups all over the world. In Japan, for example, your Pizza Hut pizza might come with hot dogs inside the crust.
Food mash-ups aren't new. But they are more popular than ever. Some say it's because people today think of food as a kind of entertainment, like movies or art. So if you'll wait in line for a concert, then why not wait in line for a Cronut?

There are fashion trends, music trends, and technology trends. And now, there are food trends, too. So what's trending today? Food mash-ups.
A food mash-up is a combination of two or more foods that don't usually go together. An example is the waffle taco, a sweet waffle with meat and eggs wrapped inside.
What started the trend? Many suggest it was the Cronut. A Cronut is a cross between a croissant and a donut. French pastry chef Dominique Ansel created the Cronut in his New York City pastry shop. It has a crispy, sugary outside, and a flaky, layered, cream-filled inside.
The Cronut is so popular that a long line forms outside the bakery before it even opens. Ansel bakes only a few hundred Cronuts each day. And he limits the number each customer can buy. (The limit was originally six, but now is two.) There are even Cronut scalpers. They wait in line for the $5 Cronut, and resell it for $50!
With the Cronut's success, many other food establishments are adding mash-ups to their menus. One example is the ramen burger. It's a hamburger with cheese in a "bun" of fried ramen noodles. And the Kogi Korean BBQ food truck in Los Angeles, California, offers their popular kimchi quesadilla, a Korean-Mexican dish.
You'll find food mash-ups all over the world. In Japan, for example, your Pizza Hut pizza might come with hot dogs embedded in the crust.
Food mash-ups aren't new but they are more popular than ever before. Some explain that in our fast-paced world we're always looking for the next big thing. Others point to the Internet, and how it helps trends spread. And others explain that food has become a form of entertainment, just like movies and art. If that's the case, then if you'll wait in line for tickets to a concert, then why not wait in line for a Cronut?

People love trends. There are fashion trends, music trends, and technology trends. It should therefore come as no surprise that there are food trends, too. And what's trending today? Food mash-ups.
Take two or more foods that you'd never dream of combining, merge them into one, and voila! You have a food mash-up. There's the waffle taco, for example, a folded waffle with meat and eggs inside. There are meatballs filled with macaroni and cheese.
What started the current food fad? Many point to the Cronut, a croissant-donut hybrid, created by French pastry chef Dominique Ansel, in his New York City pastry shop.
Ansel's creation -- which has a crispy, sugary outside, and a flaky, layered, cream-filled inside -- has a few hundred people lining up outside the bakery well before it opens, because Cronuts sell out quickly. In order to keep the demand high, Ansel limits both the number of Cronuts he makes a day (a few hundred) and the number each customer can purchase (at first six; now two).
Needless to say, there are Cronut scalpers, willing to wait in line in order to resell the $5 pastry for $50! Cronut copycats have popped up in different cities too, and in different countries.
Following the Cronut craze, restaurants, bakeries, and other eateries have been inventing their own 'Franken-foods," in the hopes of creating the next million-dollar mash-up. There's the popular ramen burger, for example, causing respectable lines of its own. The burger, sold in Brooklyn, New York, is a hamburger with cheese, nestled between two stacks of fried ramen noodles, which take the place of the traditional bun. Then there's the Kogi Korean BBQ food truck in Los Angeles, California, with its kimchi quesadilla, a Korean-Mexican delicacy.
You'll find food hybrids all over the world. Japan's Pizza Hut stores sell pizzas with hot dogs embedded in the crust, and in the Middle East, the crust has chicken fillets inside.
Food mash-ups are nothing new. Throughout history, as people of different cultures began to mix and mingle, so did their foods. But today, food mash-ups are more popular than ever.  With the world changing at lightning speed, people are always looking for the latest and greatest. And with the Internet, trends are literally created overnight.
Richard Martin, editorial director at Foodrepublic.com, explains that the concept of food has changed over the years. Today, food is a form of entertainment, much like movies and art. So, if you're willing to wait in line for a concert or to buy a blockbuster book, then maybe it's not so crazy to wait in line for a Cronut!





If you love ice cream but can't have milk products, there's good news for you. A team of researchers at Fraunhofer Institute, in Germany, have developed a non-dairy ice cream made from a plant. They use seeds of the blue sweet lupin flower, which grows in Europe. The resulting ice cream, Lupinesse, has a creamy consistency close to that of real ice cream. It has no animal proteins or animal fats, and is free of lactose, gluten, and cholesterol.

The seeds of the lupin plant have high nutritional value; they're rich in fiber and protein, and low in fat. Throughout the 1990s, researchers tried developing viable food products using lupin, but they were unsuccessful. Then, in recent years, lupin expert Gerhard Kloth suggested trying a certain variety of lupin -- the blue sweet lupin.

The seeds of this plant are very high in protein. It's the protein that gives Lupinesse its creamy texture. Lupin protein also lowers cholesterol. Lupinesse is a great ice cream option for vegans, who don't receive protein from meat, fish, or eggs. There are even benefits to growing the blue sweet lupin plant; its roots improve the quality of the soil.

There are other plant-based ice creams, made from soy, coconut, or nuts. But consumers say that Lupinesse tastes and feels closer to "the real thing." Lupin seeds, like soybeans, are legumes, and are sometimes used as a soy substitute. But Dr. Klaus Muller of Fraunhofer Institute explains why Lupinesse tastes more like real ice cream than soy ice cream. He says the secret is a combination of the natural flavor of the blue sweet lupin and the way the ice cream is produced. All legumes, including lupin, have a distinct legume flavor, but the Fraunhofer lab uses a special production process in which the legume flavor is isolated and removed.
"There has never been a product like this on the market until now," said Hans Georg Maier, Managing Director of the EDEKA supermarket chain, in Germany, where Lupinesse first debuted. "It will certainly meet with wide acceptance."
Lupinesse comes in four flavors: Vanilla-Cherry, Strawberry-Mousse, Walnut Dream and Choco-Flakes. It's currently available in Germany only, in EDEKA supermarkets. But with all its benefits, it's probably safe to assume that Lupinesse will one day become an international treat.

Do you love ice cream, but can't have milk? There's good news for you! Researchers at Fraunhofer Institute, in Germany, have developed a non-dairy ice cream from plant-based ingredients. They use seeds of the blue sweet lupin flower. The ice cream, Lupinesse, is free of lactose, gluten, cholesterol, and animal proteins and fats.

The lupin plant is high in fiber and protein, and low in fat. In the 1990s, researchers tried to develop food products using lupin, but were unsuccessful. Then, lupin expert Gerhard Kloth suggested using a specific kind of lupin - the blue sweet lupin, from Europe. It's very high in protein, which makes Lupinesse ice cream very creamy.

There are other plant-based ice creams on the market, many made from soy. But consumers say Lupinesse tastes more authentic. Dr. Klaus Muller of Fraunhofer Institute says there are two reasons. First, is the taste of the blue sweet lupin seeds. Second, is the Lupinesse production process. Lupin and soy are both legumes - beans that grow in a pod, such as peas or peanuts. All legumes have a noticeable legume flavor. But the Fraunhofer lab figured out a way to remove that flavor, so it tastes less like an ice cream substitute, and more like ice cream.

Lupinesse comes in four flavors: Vanilla-Cherry, Strawberry-Mousse, Walnut Dream and Choco-Flakes. At this time, it's only available in Germany at EDEKA supermarkets. Hans Georg Maier, managing director of EDEKA, says, "There has never been a product like this on the market until now. It will certainly meet with wide acceptance." If he's right, we may be seeing Lupinesse in other countries soon.
 

Cream of the Crop
Business
Researchers at Fraunhofer Institute, in Germany, learned how to make ice cream from a plant. It's not real ice cream, because it doesn't have milk. But it tastes like ice cream. And it's creamy like ice cream. They made the ice cream from the beans, or seeds, of the blue sweet lupin flower. They call the ice cream "Lupinesse." Lupin seeds have a lot of protein. The protein makes the ice cream very creamy. It also makes it healthier than other ice creams.

Lupinesse has no lactose or gluten. So it's good for people with certain food allergies. It's also good for vegans. Vegans don't get protein from fish, meat, or eggs. Lupinesse also has no cholesterol.

Some companies make non-dairy ice cream from soybeans. But people say Lupinesse tastes better. This is because of the flavor of the blue sweet lupin and because Fraunhofer removes the bean flavor.

Right now, you will only find Lupinesse in EDEKA supermarkets, in Germany. But if it's successful, you may start seeing it in supermarkets around the world.




Mystery Shoppers
Business
Do you enjoy detective work? Then be a mystery shopper! Mystery shoppers are people who go into stores or other businesses. They pretend to be customers. But they are really checking the quality of the business. They check, for example,  how good the customer service is.
Heads of businesses use mystery shoppers to investigate their own companies. They want to know how their companies can improve. The business hires a mystery shopping company (MSC). The MSC hires a mystery shopper. The MSC tells the mystery shopper what to look for.
While mystery shoppers act like ordinary customers, they also pay attention to details. A  mystery shopper in a restaurant might look to see how clean the silverware is, or how long it takes to get his or her meal. Mystery shoppers look to see how friendly the staff is. Then they tell the MSC what they found out.  Mystery shoppers need to remember everything by heart, because they aren't allowed to write anything down.
There are mystery shoppers in many different service industries. These include hotels, gas stations, stores, and banks. Even doctors' offices and hospitals use "mystery patients."
There are 1.5 million mystery shoppers in the world. Contact an MSC and see how you can become one of them!

Do you enjoy detective work, and want to earn extra money? Then try being a mystery shopper! Companies and organizations hire mystery shoppers to check the quality of a business' services. The mystery shopper enters a business and pretends to be an ordinary customer. But he or she is actually evaluating the business and seeing how it treats its customers.
Mystery shoppers might check how fast the service is, or how helpful the staff is. They may return an item, or ask a salesperson a question. They're not allowed to write anything down, or the staff might realize who they are. They also need to pay attention to details. When mystery shoppers finish their "investigation," they tell their employers what they found out.
Companies don't hire mystery shoppers directly. They contact a mystery shopping company, or MSC. The MSC hires the mystery shopper, and tells him or her what to look out for. Organizations might want a mystery shopper to see if a company is following certain laws. Heads of companies might want mystery shoppers to investigate their own companies, to see what can be improved.  
To apply for a mystery shopping job, go to an MSC Web site. There will be online job postings, where you can apply for a specific mystery shopping job. Each job has a one-time contract, so you'll have to apply for each job separately. Mystery shoppers are not full-time staff of the MSC.
Mystery shopping is a $1.5 billion industry, with 1.5 million employees around the world. A variety of service industries use mystery shoppers - from hotels, gas stations, stores, and fast food chains to banks, health clubs, and public transportation systems. Even doctors' offices and hospitals use "mystery patients." Medical facilities in the U.S. say mystery patients have improved patient satisfaction.
You can be your own mystery shopper, even without applying. The next time you're happy or unhappy with a business' services, just let them know!

Business
If you enjoy detective work and want to earn some extra money, try being a mystery shopper. Mystery shoppers are hired to check how well a business is running, and the quality of its customer service. The staff that's being evaluated doesn't know that the person is a mystery shopper.
The mystery shopper enters the business pretending to be an ordinary consumer, but is really paying attention to everything he or she was instructed to notice. Mystery shoppers might check how long it takes to be greeted at a restaurant, for example, how quick the service is, or how helpful the staff is. Mystery shoppers may purchase a product, ask questions, or return an item. They then report back to their employer with specific feedback.
In order not to give away their identities, mystery shoppers aren't allowed to write anything down. They therefore need to remember everything by heart. They also need to be very detail-oriented. "Good mystery shoppers have great eyes," says Joan Pajunen, president of marketing research and consulting company TrendSpeak International. "They're really curious and they see lots of little things that should be tweaked."
Organizations might want a mystery shopper to check if a business is following certain laws. Heads of companies might want mystery shoppers to check the quality of their own companies' services. But organizations and companies don't hire mystery shoppers directly. They hire a mystery-shopping company, or MSC. And the MSC hires the mystery shopper.
To become a mystery shopper, one signs up with an MSC. The MSC has online bulletin boards where shoppers can search and apply for individual jobs. MSCs don't hire mystery shoppers as permanent staff. Each job is a onetime contract, so mystery shoppers have to apply for each job separately.
Many different service industries use mystery shoppers - from hotels, gas stations, stores, and fast food chains, to banks, health clubs, and public transportation systems. Even some doctors' offices and hospitals use "mystery patients." Medical facilities in the U.S. say mystery patients have led to improvements in the patient experience.
Companies find mystery shoppers helpful because customers often don't speak their minds. When customers are upset with a company's service, they usually just leave and take their business elsewhere, instead of voicing their complaints. As consumers, we should tell businesses what we think of their customer service. This way we can be "mystery shoppers" without even signing up.
 





What can bring more visitors to your company's website, motivate you to exercise, or encourage you to recycle? The answer is gamification. Gamification is the process of adding game-style activities to non-game applications or experiences to make them fun and engaging. In other words, it's making non-game entities game-like.
For example, hamburger chain White Castle is using gamification as a marketing tool. Its CraverNation website offers challenges so you can win virtual or physical rewards. A virtual reward may be points, an achievement badge, or having your name posted on a list of highest scorers. You can also receive rewards on the site for posting photos and videos. The result? Thousands of "cravers" are active on the site each day.
Gamification is one of the most effective and profitable marketing methods today. By 2014, it's expected that 70% of the world's top businesses will be "gamified." Gamification is a powerful motivator, because it taps into people's innate competitiveness. 
The term "gamification" was coined in 2002, and became popular in 2010. Yet the concept is much older. In 1896, Thomas Sperry and Shelley Byron Hutchinson introduced S&H Green Stamps. Stores gave these stamps to customers for purchasing certain items. People traded these stamps for prizes. This was an early example of gamification. 
Organizations, schools, and individuals are using gamification, too. They're using it for everything from fighting poverty to encouraging healthy living. The website Zamzee encourages kids to be physically active. Children wear a small meter to measure their activity throughout the day. Then they plug the meter into the computer and visit the Zamzee website. There, they can track their progress, create avatars, connect with other Zamzee users, earn points based on their progress, and receive rewards. 
But gamification can be simple, too. Professional networking site LinkedIn displays a progress bar to encourage users to complete their profiles. A progress bar is a graphic showing what percentage of a task you have completed, and how much you have left to do. This simple gaming feature works because of the human desire for completion. 
Gamification also exists in real-world settings. When you drop a bottle in a certain recycle bin in Sweden, the bin makes noises and lights up, like an arcade game. And a speed camera rewards drivers who obey the speed limit with entry into a lottery. 
You'll find gamification everywhere you look. In fact, many say that if you're looking to create a buzz around a website or project, gamification is the only game in town!

Gaming is a very successful industry. People love playing games on their computers and hand-held devices. 
Businesses realize how successful gaming is. That's why many are adding game features to their websites. This is called gamification. In gamification, you figure out what parts, or features, of a game make it fun. Then you add some of these features (such as challenges and rewards) to things that are not games. 
White Castle sells hamburgers. To create a buzz around their hamburgers, they made the "CraverNation" website. On the site, you can take challenges to win rewards. You also earn rewards for posting photos and videos. This is an example of gamification. And it's working. Thousands of people are active on the site each day. It's no surprise, then, that gamification is one of the most effective marketing methods today.

Organizations, schools, and individuals use gamification too. They might use it to help students learn, or to encourage people to save energy.

Afterwards, kids plug the meter into a computer and visit the Zamzee website. There, they can track their progress and earn rewards. They can also create avatars and connect with other Zamzee users.
We may also see gamification in our everyday lives. A recycle bin in Sweden plays sounds and lights flash like an arcade game when you drop a bottle inside. And a speed camera rewards drivers who don't speed by entering them in a lottery.

People play games on their TVs, computers, and cell phones. Gaming is a very big business. 
Gaming is so popular, that many companies are making their websites more game-like. They do this to get more visitors. This is called gamification.
Gamification is not playing games. It's taking something that's not a game and adding game elements to it. Two game elementsare competition and rewards. 
White Castle sells hamburgers. On their website, you can enter contests to win prizes. You also get rewards for posting pictures and videos. This is gamification, and it's working. Thousands of people visit the site each day.
Another example is an app from sports company Nike. It tells you how far and fast you're running. It compares this run to past runs. It works because people like to compete, even against themselves. 
Gamification is a new word. But it's not a new idea. Back in 1896, stores gave people special stamps (S&H Green Stamps) for buying certain items. People traded these stamps for prizes. 
Businesses are not the only ones that use gamification. Schools and organizations do too. Their gamification may get students to study harder or reward people for saving energy.
We also see gamification in real life. In Sweden, there's a fun recycle bin. When you drop a bottle into the bin, it makes noises and lights flash, like an arcade game. People stand in line to recycle!
So, if you want to attract people to your website or project, gamification is a good game plan!

It's hard not to be awed by the magnificence of the Japanese kimono. A kimono, literally translated as "a thing to wear", is a traditional floor-length Japanese garment once worn by men, women and children on a daily basis. However, if you visit Tokyo today, you'd be hard-pressed to find even one Japanese citizen strolling the city streets in a vibrantly-colored and expertly-crafted kimono. Today, most Japanese wear kimonos only on special occasions such as weddings, funerals and festivals. The widespread adoption of Western dress, combined with the dying out of the few kimono craftsmen left in Japan, is threatening the entire kimono industry.
With over 1,000 processes involved in the crafting of a hand-made kimono, mastering a single technique can take decades. Yasutaka Komiya is 84 years old and began learning the craft of kimono-making when he was just 12. He is the only known kimono artist who is still able to paint silk kimonos in pure gold. Komiya has even been granted the title "Living National Treasure", an official title given by the government which categorizes him as "a living, breathing cultural asset to be protected". According to Komiya, the kimono industry, which was once supported by thousands of craftsmen, has dwindled to only three families of craftsmen who are capable of creating these works of art. Komiya has taught his son, Yasumasa, the art of kimono-making, and Yasumasa is passing down the craft to his sons as well. Acording to Yasumasa, "It's important for the kimono industry to evolve and modernize in order to survive. Traditional craftsmanship should ideally be passed on from generation to generation, but this is not going to be possible in the future."
Soichi Sajiki's family has been in the kimono business for two centuries, and he says sales have dropped to a tenth of what they were 30 years ago. He is also desperate to try and save this priceless piece of Japanese culture and says it's imperative that the skills are passed onto the next generation. In an effort to renew the enthusiasm for kimono-wearing among young women, Mr. Sajiki, as chairman of the Tokyo Kimono Business Association, decided to host a Kimono Week. Forty-eight young women were chosen to compete to earn the crown of the Tokyo Kimono Queen.
The threat isn't just the lack of craftsmen, but also lack of interest on the part of consumers. Today's Japanese generation doesn't value the kimono the same way previous generations have. They only wear the traditional Japanese outfit a few times a year at most, and it is becoming more and more common to buy the less expensive machine-made variety. After all, a hand-made kimono is quite the investment, running between 180,000 and 1 million yen ($2,100 - $12,100).
Looking towards new business opportunities outside of Japan may be the only way to sustain this threatened industry. Japan can no longer rely on its own people to keep the kimono industry alive. Communications director at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, Chie Hayakawa, explains the importance of sharing the beauty of the kimono with the global community. She says that, "These hand-crafted fabrics should be more widely used internationally, with more collaborations with high profile fashion designers. There is so much potential." Let's hope this potential is reached so the kimono can continue to be a living symbol of Japanese culture.

The Future of Kimonos
Business
A kimono, Japanese for "a thing to wear", is a traditional floor-length Japanese garment which men, women and children used to wear every day. Today, however, most Japanese only wear kimonos on special occasions, such as weddings, funerals and festivals. Even then, many buy cheaper machine-made kimonos because they don't want to spend between 180,000 and one million yen ($2,100 - $12,100) on a hand-made one. This, together with the fact that there aren't many professional kimono-makers left, is threatening the kimono industry.
There are over 1,000 procedures needed to make a hand-made kimono. Learning each technique takes years. Yasutaka Komiya is 84 years old and began learning how to make kimonos when he was only 12. He is the only known kimono artist who is still knows how to paint silk kimonos in pure gold. The government considers Komiya to be a "Living National Treasure". This is an official honor that is given by the government to uniquely talented and important people like Komiya. According to Komiya, there are only a few families remaining in Japan who have the skills to create these works of art.
Komiya has taught his son, Yasumasa how to make kimonos. Yasumasa is passing the skill down to his sons as well. Yasumasa says "It's important for the kimono industry to evolve and modernize in order to survive. Traditional craftsmanship should ideally be passed on from generation to generation, but this is not going to be possible in the future."
Soichi Sajiki's family has been in the kimono business for two centuries. Mr. Sajiki is trying to save the kimono business. He is chairman of the Tokyo Kimono Business Association. He decided to host a Kimono Week to get Japanese youth excited about kimonos. Forty-eight young women competed to earn the title of Tokyo Kimono Queen.
Some think that Japan must begin to consider other options for keeping the kimono industry alive. The communications director at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, Chie Hayakawa, thinks that Japan's kimonos should be exported. She also feels that kimonos should be marketed to fashion designers. Hayakawa is hopeful and believes "there is so much potential" for the kimono industry.

The Future of Kimonos
Business
A kimono is a special kind of Japanese clothing. In English, kimono means "a thing to wear". Japanese men, women and children used to wear kimonos all the time. Now, most people just wear kimonos for weddings, funerals and festivals.
Not many people know how to make hand-made kimonos. Most of these craftsmen are very old. It takes many years to learn the art of kimono-making. Yasutaka Komiya is 84 years old. He began learning how to make kimonos when he was only 12. He is the only person who still knows how to paint silk kimonos in pure gold. The government calls him a "Living National Treasure". Komiya is teaching his sons and grandsons.
Many kimono makers are worried about the future of the kimono business. Japanese people don't buy hand-made kimonos as much as they used to because today they wear Western clothing. When they do buy kimonos, they usually buy ones that are machine-made. This is because machine-made kimonos are much cheaper than hand-made kimonos. A hand-made kimono costs between180,000 and one million yen ($2,100 - $12,100).
Some people feel that the only way to save the kimono business to start exporting kimonos to other countries. Maybe one day kimonos will be popular in other countries, too!




SoFi the Spy Fish
Science & Technology
A white fish swims in the ocean. But it's not a real fish. It's SoFi, the robot fish! SoFi helps scientists learn about the world's oceans.
It's hard to study the ocean. Human divers try to watch fish underwater. But the fish get scared and swim away. So scientists use robots with video cameras. The robots move in the ocean. They "spy" on fish, and record what they "see."
Many underwater robots have a cable. The cable connects them to a boat. These robots cannot go very far from the boat. But SoFi has no cable. A diver uses a remote control underwater to move SoFi. SoFi can explore many different parts of the ocean.
SoFi looks like a fish. It has a soft body, fins, and a tail. SoFi also moves like a fish. Real fish aren't afraid of SoFi.
SoFi can help scientists understand water pollution. SoFi can help scientists find new ocean animals. Scientists plan to make many SoFi robots. The robots will swim in groups, and explore the oceans together.

SoFi the Spy Fish
Science & Technology
A white fish swims through the ocean, moving its tail from side to side. But this is not an ordinary fish. It's SoFi, the robotic fish. SoFi (pronounced "so-fee") helps scientists explore the world's oceans.
 
Many fish are scared of human divers, swimming away quickly when the divers get too close. So researchers use underwater robots with video cameras to "spy" for them. SoFi is the most advanced of these robots. It was developed at CSAIL, a laboratory at MIT, a university in Massachusetts, USA.
 
Many underwater robots are connected to a boat by a long cable. The cable limits where the robots can go; they can't move around freely. But SoFi has no cable. It can swim all around. A diver controls SoFi underwater using a remote control device.
 
Another benefit to SoFi is that it looks and moves like a real fish. It has a soft body ("SoFi" stands for "soft" and "fish"), with two fins and a tail. And since it looks like a fish, real fish either ignore it or swim along next to it.
 
SoFi has a video camera in its head that records what it "sees." This helps scientists learn important information about the world's oceans. For example, SoFi can help scientists understand how pollution affects the ocean. It can also help scientists discover new types of animals in the sea.
 
Daniela Rus, the director of CSAIL, says, "To find out about the secret lives of animals that live underwater, we need to collect more data." Rus plans to make many more SoFi robots. Then, groups of SoFi robots will explore the world's oceans together.

SoFi the Spy Fish
Science & Technology
A white fish glides along a coral reef, its tail moving gently from side to side. But it's no ordinary fish. It is SoFi, the robotic fish. SoFi (pronounced "so-fee") helps scientists explore the world's oceans.
 
Human divers scare fish away when they try to observe ocean life from up close. So researchers use underwater robots with video cameras to "spy" for them. SoFi, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's CSAIL lab, is one of the most advanced of these robots.
 
Many other robots are connected to a boat by a long cable. These robots can go deep in the water, but they have limited movement. SoFi has no cable, so it can move freely in the water. A diver controls SoFi underwater, using a waterproof remote control device. The diver can be over 15 meters away from SoFi. SoFi is also quiet, unlike many other underwater robots that make noise and disturb ocean life.
 
There are other remote control underwater robots, but they can only swim in shallow water. This is because they use radio waves, which don't transmit well underwater. SoFi, on the other hand, uses sound waves, which transmit underwater very well.
 
Another benefit to SoFi is its design. It looks and moves very much like a real fish. SoFi has a soft body ("SoFi" stands for "soft" and "fish"), with two side fins and a tail that wiggles as it swims, making the robot very agile. And since it resembles a fish, SoFi doesn't scare real fish away. Robert Katzschmann, the head of the team that developed SoFi, says that during test runs, fish would even swim alongside the robot.
 
With its built-in video camera, SoFi records what it "sees". This helps scientists uncover important information, such as how climate change and overfishing affect the world's oceans, how quickly pollution is destroying ocean habitats, and where to find new species of sea animals and plants.
 
In the future, there could be schools of SoFi robots exploring the world's oceans. "We view SoFi as a first step toward developing almost an underwater observatory..." says CSAIL director Daniela Rus. The SoFi team is excited to see what its robot fish may discover.




The Quietest Place on Earth
Science & Technology
Life is filled with noise - phones beep, cars honk, dogs bark. Sometimes we want to block it all out and experience silence. But is there such a thing as too much silence? Ask Hundraj Gopal. Gopal works for technology company Microsoft. He's the head engineer of Microsoft's anechoic chamber. An anechoic chamber is a soundproof room (anechoic means "no echo"). It keeps out noise from the outside, and absorbs noise from the inside.

Microsoft's anechoic chamber, located in Washington, USA, is used to test and analyze noises made by the company's products, such as microphones and speakers. Microsoft's anechoic chamber is the quietest place on Earth. It has a sound level of -20.6 decibels. That's 20 decibels below the level of human hearing.

Many factors make the room so quiet. The chamber's outer walls are made of six layers of concrete. The room's inner walls and ceilings are lined with fiberglass wedges, which absorb 99.99 percent of the sound waves produced; they keep the sound waves from bouncing back into the room. The floor you walk on is a net of steel that sits above more wedges, which line the bottom of the chamber.

Not everyone finds the silence of the anechoic chamber peaceful. Sound puts pressure on human eardrums; when there's no sound, there's no pressure. This absence of pressure creates strange sensory experiences. In an anechoic chamber you may hear your heart beat, your blood flow through your veins, and your bones grind as you move. You may have difficulty keeping your balance. The feeling is so strange that many people can't stay in the chamber for more than a few seconds. "It unsettles almost everybody," says Gopal. "They can hear people breathing on the other side of the room and hear stomachs gurgling. A small number of people feel dizzy."

Would you like to try out an anechoic chamber, and see how long you last? Microsoft's quiet room isn't open to the public, but the anechoic chamber at Orfield Labs, in Minnesota, USA, is. In fact, Orfield Labs held the record for the world's quietest place (-13 decibels) until Microsoft beat their record in 2015. "We didn't set out to build the quietest chamber on the planet," Says Gopal. Nevertheless, they succeeded!

The Quietest Place on Earth
Science & Technology
There is noise all around us. Phones beep, cars honk, and dogs bark. Sometimes we just want quiet. But is there such a thing as too much quiet? Ask Hundraj Gopal, an engineer for technology company Microsoft. Gopal designed Microsoft's anechoic chamber. An anechoic chamber is a soundproof room.

Microsoft's anechoic chamber, in Washington, USA, is the quietest place on Earth. The company uses the room to measure noises that come from their devices, such as microphones and speakers. In an anechoic chamber, sounds don't echo. Instead of bouncing off the walls, the sounds get absorbed.

The chamber's inner walls and ceiling are covered with fiberglass wedges. The floor is covered with fiberglass wedges too, but you don't walk on them. You walk on a metal net floor that lies above the wedges. The wedges absorb 99.99% of the sound made inside the room. The chamber is deep inside a building, which also helps to make it quiet, and the chamber's outer walls are made from six layers of concrete.

Many people feel strange inside the anechoic chamber. This is because sound puts pressure on human eardrums. When there's no sound, there's no pressure. People aren't used to this feeling. In the chamber, many people find it hard to stand without falling. They hear themselves breathing, and their hearts beating. Many people don't like the feeling, and leave after just a few seconds.

Microsoft's anechoic chamber isn't open to the public. But you can visit an anechoic chamber at Orfield Labs, in Minnesota, USA.

How long do you think you'll last inside?

The Quietest Place on Earth
Science & Technology
Where is the quietest place on Earth? The answer may surprise you.

The quietest place on Earth is a room inside a building, in Washington, USA. The room belongs to the technology company Microsoft. Microsoft uses the room to check how noisy their products are. They test their microphones, speakers, and other products. When a room is very quiet, it's easier to hear very soft noises.

Hundraj Gopal is an engineer. He built Microsoft's quiet room. Gopal covered the walls, floor, and ceiling of the room with triangle-shaped pieces of fiberglass. The fiberglass absorbs sound. It doesn't let sound echo. With no echo, the room stays quiet.

Microsoft's room is so quiet you can hear yourself breathe. You can even hear your heart beat! Many people feel strange inside the quiet room. They can only stay inside for a few seconds.

How long do you think you can stay in Microsoft's quiet room?





In Texas, USA, there is a very big mountain. Inside the mountain, people are making a special clock.  The clock will keep time for 10,000 years. Tick, tock - it's the 10,000 Year Clock!
William Daniel Hillis is the inventor of the 10,000 Year Clock. Today, workers are making the huge clock that Hillis designed. The clock will be 500-feet (152.4 meters) tall. The clock will have ten bells. The bells will play a tune. Each time the clock chimes, it will play a different tune. Hillis hopes his 10,000 Year Clock will make people think about the future.
There will also be five rooms inside the mountain. One room will have a model of the solar system. On the clock's anniversary, the model will move. The planets will move around the Sun.
Some people will try to visit the 10,000 Year Clock. But it will be very hard to get to!

10,000 Year Clock
Science & Technology
Right now, in an isolated mountain in the USA, a special clock is being built. Tick, tock - it's the 10,000 Year Clock!
William Daniel Hillis is a computer scientist and inventor. In 1989, he decided to build a clock that would keep time for 10,000 years. Hillis hoped it would encourage people to think about the distant future and not just about what's happening now. In 1996, Hillis and his friend Stewart Brand started The Long Now Foundation. The foundation is in charge of building the clock.
Construction of the 500-foot-tall (152.4-meter-tall) 10,000 Year Clock has already begun. The clock will be placed deep inside a mountain in a remote area of Texas, USA. The clock will have 10 bells. When the clock chimes, the bells will ring in a certain order, creating a melody. Every time the clock chimes, a new melody will be played. 
Builders are also carving five rooms out of the mountain. Each room will celebrate a different anniversary of the clock. The first room will have a model of the solar system. On each one-year anniversary of the clock, the model will turn on, and the "planets" will move. The second room will have a model for the ten-year anniversary. The other rooms are for the clock's 100th, 1,000th, and 10,000th anniversaries.
It'll be very hard to visit the 10,000 Year Clock, but not impossible. If you e-mail The Long Now Foundation, they'll let you know when the clock is finished. The Long Now Foundation is planning to build more 10,000 Year Clocks. They've already chosen the next clock's location, in Nevada, USA.

10,000 Year Clock
Science & Technology
A special clock, designed to keep time for 10,000 years, is being constructed deep inside a mountain. It's called the 10,000 Year Clock, and most of the people on Earth today will never hear it chime.

The idea for the clock, and its design, came from computer scientist and inventor William Daniel Hillis. For years, Hillis has been interested in the way people think about, and measure, time. In 1989, he started devising a clock that would run for 10,000 years. He wanted to build a clock whose future is as long as the world's past. So, in 1996, Hillis and his friend Stewart Brand founded The Long Now Foundation. They called it "long now" to indicate that people should consider time in the long-term, instead of just the short-term.  The organization, which oversees the building of the clock, completed an eight-foot-tall (2.44 meters) working prototype in 1999.
 
Construction of a full-sized, 500-foot-tall (152.4 meters) 10,000 Year Clock is currently underway. The massive clock will be placed deep inside a mountain in a remote area of Texas, USA. The clock will have ten bells, which will ring in a certain sequence, to produce a melody. Each time the clock chimes, the sequence will change, so the melody will always be new.

Five chambers will also be carved into the mountain, to celebrate the clock's one-, 10-, 100-, 1,000-, and 10,000-year anniversaries. In each chamber there will be a different model. The first chamber will have a model of the solar system. On each one-year anniversary, the clock will animate the model. The foundation will also design a model for the 10-year anniversary chamber. The rest of the chambers will be left for future generations to fill.

Once completed, the 10,000 Year Clock will be difficult, but not impossible, to visit. The trail to the clock rises almost 2,000 feet (609.6 meters) above the valley below. However, you can try. If you send an e-mail to The Long Now Foundation, they will let you know when the clock is finished. The clock in Texas will be the first of many 10,000 Year Clocks. The Long Now Foundation has already chosen the next clock's site, in Nevada, USA.




Digital Medicine
Science & Technology
Suffering from hearing loss? Play a video game. That's right, you heard correctly. An alternative to traditional treatments prescribed by doctors is being researched. Introducing "digital medicine".

One research team, led by Professor Daniel Polley of Harvard Medical School, has made significant progress in showing the efficacy of video games on improving hearing. People with hearing loss have a hard time hearing in places where there is a lot of background noise. A group of elderly adults with hearing loss played a video game designed by Polley and his team. Players needed to solve a puzzle by listening for words. The catch was that the words being spoken were accompanied by background noise that gradually increased in loudness. The result? After two months of playing the game, the group could hear 25% more words being spoken in real-life noisy settings. 

A company called Akili, together with the Neuroscape lab (at the University of California, San Francisco), is also using digital medicine, to help with other conditions. Their research focuses on improving the lives of people with diseases or disorders such as ADHD, depression, autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. They are administering these games in clinical trials and are in the process of gathering data to submit to the FDA. Since these games are intended to treat medical conditions, they need to go through the same approval process as medications.

One of Akili's games is Project: EVO, designed for children with ADHD. In the game, players must make instant decisions and tune out distractions. This helps players improve their concentration. If Project: EVO gets approval, it will be the first prescription-based video game in the US.

Another game, BBT (Body Brain Trainer), is designed to improve brain function. As players complete tasks involving Mayan warriors, they are presented with physical and cognitive challenges.

Many researchers maintain that positive effects from mental-training video games have not been supported with evidence. Akili and Neuroscape are trying to change that. Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist and founder of Neuroscape, has been working for the last 12 years to provide scientific data in support of his video games.

The efforts of Daniel Polley and Adam Gazzaley certainly seem promising. A healthy dose of digital medicine may be just what the doctor ordered!

Do you have trouble hearing? Play a video game! Doctors may soon give patients video games to play, instead of medicine. This kind of treatment is called "digital medicine".

Professor Daniel Polley made a video game to help people with hearing loss. His game teaches them to hear better in places with background noise. In the game, players listen to words. When they hear the words, they also hear background noise. The background noise gets louder and louder. People with hearing loss played Polley's game. After two months, they could hear better in noisy places.

Akili and Neuroscape are two companies who are also making "digital medicine". Their games help people with disorders such as ADHD, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. One game is Project: EVO. It's a video game for children with ADHD. Children with ADHD have a hard time focusing. In the game, players fly a spaceship. But objects get in their way. Players must ignore these objects. This game helps players learn to focus.

Video games can be good for your health!




The Gravity Light
Science & Technology
About 1.2 billion people in the world have no electricity. To make light, they use kerosene lamps. But kerosene is not healthy to breathe. It causes fires. It's bad for the environment. And it costs a lot of money.

Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves are designers. They invented a light to replace kerosene lamps. They call it GravityLight. It uses gravity to make light.

With GravityLight, you put a weight on a plastic cord. You pull on the cord to lift the weight. Then you let go. Gravity pulls the weight back down. But the weight falls very slowly. As the weight falls, it turns gears. The gears power a motor. The motor powers a light. The light stays on for 20 minutes, while the weight falls. When the weight stops falling, the light goes off. Then you start again.

GravityLight is safe. It doesn't cost a lot of money to buy. And it costs nothing to use. It even gives more light than kerosene lamps. Riddford and Reeves hope GravityLight will give people a brighter future!

The Gravity Light
Science & Technology
About 1.2 billion people in the world have no electricity. Many of them live in poverty in Africa and India. When they need light, they use kerosene lamps. But kerosene is unhealthy to breathe. It causes burns and fires. It's also bad for the environment, and costs a lot of money.

Designers Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves heard about the problem, and wanted to solve it. So they invented a light to replace kerosene lamps. It's called GravityLight. GravityLight uses gravity to make light.

How does it work? GravityLight uses a pulley system. First, you take the bag that comes with GravityLight and fill it with rocks to make a weight. You attach the weight to the end of a plastic cord. Then you pull on the other end to lift the weight up. You lift the weight as high as it goes. Then you let go.

Gravity makes the weight fall back down, but the weight falls very slowly. As it falls, it turns gears. The gears power a motor. The motor powers an LED light, which is brighter than the light of a kerosene lamp. The LED light stays on the whole time while the weight is falling. That's about 20 minutes. When the weight stops falling, the light goes off. To turn it back on, you lift the weight again.

GravityLight is safe for people and the environment. It has a one-time cost of $25, and costs nothing to run. GravityLight also creates jobs, because it's sold in Kenya, by Kenyans.

Riddiford and Reeves hope GravityLight will give people living in poverty a brighter future!

The Gravity Light
Science & Technology
Two London designers, Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves, learned of a global problem. Approximately 1.2 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity. Most of them live in remote areas of Africa and India, in extreme poverty. In order to have light, they use kerosene lamps. Kerosene is widely available, but it's unhealthy to inhale, causes burns and fires, and is bad for the environment. It's also expensive; for many families, 30% of the money they earn is spent on kerosene. So, Riddiford and Reeves set out to find a kerosene lamp substitute.

To start, they looked at alternative lighting devices that already existed. But they found that these devices weren't cheap enough to replace kerosene lighting. Riddiford and Reeves realized that they would have to invent a new device, without any operating costs. The solution they came up with? GravityLight - a device that powers a light using weight and gravity.

GravityLight is a pulley system. To use it, you attach a weight to a plastic cord. (The weight is simply a bag you fill with rocks or sand.) You pull on the cord to lift the weight up; then you let go. The weight falls back down, but very slowly. As the weight falls, it turns gears in the device. The gears power a motor. The motor powers an LED light. After about 20 minutes, the weight reaches the bottom and the light goes off. To turn it back on, you just lift the weight again and repeat the process. The light that GravityLight produces is five times as bright as the light of a kerosene lamp.

GravityLight is a safe, environmentally friendly, kerosene lamp alternative. It doesn't require sunlight, batteries, or charging. You can get light instantly, at any time. And GravityLight costs nothing to run. The device, which costs $25, will pay for itself within two to three months, and after that, users will save money. GravityLight will also provide people with jobs, as GravityLight is being assembled and sold in Kenya by local residents.

With their invention, Riddiford and Reeves hope to provide the 1.2 billion people living off-grid with a brighter future!
 





How many electronic products did you throw away last year?  Perhaps you threw away a printer, a computer, or a cellphone? When people throw out electronic products, it creates electronic waste.  The United Nations Environment Program reported that almost 50 million tons of electronic waste will be thrown out this year; that's 20% higher than in 2015. Around 3.14 million tons of electronic waste is created each year just in the United States. About 40% of this waste is recycled into new products, and the rest goes into landfills. But there may now be a solution to this growing problem -- biodegradable electronics!
Biodegradable electronics could break down naturally into smaller pieces that are not harmful to the environment. As the number of electronics we use increases, the need for biodegradable electronics will increase as well. Stanford University engineer Zhenan Bao and her team of scientists have created a biodegradable semiconductor. Semiconductors are needed to make many electronic products work. What's special about Bao's semiconductor is that it easily biodegrades when you put it in a weak acid, such as vinegar. 

Bao's biodegradable semiconductor is made of two main materials. One of the materials is iron. Regular electronic parts use gold, but Bao noted that iron is very environmentally friendly, so she decided to use it instead. The other material used in the semiconductor is cellulose. Cellulose makes up certain materials, like paper and cloth. The cellulose in the semiconductor makes it transparent, and incredibly thin and flexible. The thinness allows it to be worn on the skin or even inside the body. The team found that the semiconductor could easily be broken down by adjusting the chemical structure of the iron and the cellulose. Bao's team hopes that biodegradable electronics will lead to the creation of less electronic waste.

One of the main ways Bao would like to see biodegradable electronics used is in medical devices. "We envision these soft patches that are very thin and conformable to the skin that can measure blood pressure, glucose value, sweat content," Bao said. You could wear the patch for a week, and download the information from it. Then, when you no longer need it, you could drop the patch into a bowl of vinegar and watch it slowly melt away!

The End of Electronic Waste

How many electronic products did you throw away last year? Maybe you threw away a computer or a cellphone? When people throw out electronic products, it creates electronic waste. Each year, the Unites States creates about 3.14 million tons of electronic waste. Around the world, people will throw out almost 50 million tons of electronic waste in just one year. That's 20% more than in 2015. Electronic waste is becoming a big problem. Soon, however, there may be a solution -- biodegradable electronics!
Biodegradable electronics can break down into smaller pieces that are not harmful to the environment. Stanford University engineer Zhenan Bao and her team of scientists have created a biodegradable semiconductor. Semiconductors are needed to make many electronic products work.

The cellulose in the semiconductor makes it clear. It's also very thin and flexible. This makes the semiconductor perfect for wearing on the skin or even inside the body.

Bao thinks biodegradable electronics should be used for medical devices. She hopes to create a soft, thin patch that can measure your blood pressure and the amount of sugar in your blood. You could wear the patch for a week, and download the information from it. Then, when you no longer needed the patch, you could just drop it into a bowl of vinegar and watch it slowly melt away!

There is a new monkey in the wild. But the monkey isn't real. It is a robot that looks like a monkey.
The robot monkey is a "Spy Creature." One of its eyes is a camera. The Spy Creature films animals in the wild.  The Spy Creature is filming a documentary. It is called Spy in the Wild.  The documentary lets us see animals up close.
There are other Spy Creatures in the film, too. There is a hippo and a baby crocodile. There are 34 Spy Creatures altogether. The Spy Creatures look like real animals. They move like real animals. They even smell like real animals.
John Downer produced the film. Using Spy Creatures was his idea. Since Spy Creatures are lifelike, they don't scare the animals away.
To make Spy in the Wild, Downer and his team went to 31 countries. Their Spy Creatures filmed for 8,000 hours. The documentary took three years to make. But it was worth the wait.

The robot monkey is a "Spy Creature." It is a robot created to spy on animals for a documentary called Spy in the Wild.  But the monkey isn't the only Spy Creature. There are 34 Spy Creatures altogether. Other Spy Creatures include a hippo, an orangutan, a tortoise, and a baby crocodile.
John Downer is the film's producer. Downer thought of the idea to use Spy Creatures to film animal documentaries. At first, Downer disguised his cameras as rocks. Then, he began to disguise them as animals.
The Spy Creatures used in Spy in the Wild, are the most advanced Spy Creatures yet. They have high-definition cameras in their eyes. They look like animals, move like animals, and even smell like animals. They also make animal sounds. Real animals think the robots are just like them. So they are not afraid of them.
Spy in the Wild gives viewers a close up look at more than 30 animals around the world.  To film the documentary, film crews traveled with their Spy Creatures to 31 countries. They collected 8,000 hours (11 months) of footage. The film took three years to make.
Spy in the Wild explores the ways that animals and people are alike. It makes viewers question whether or not animals feel friendship or love. Thanks to great work of the Spy Creature photographers, we can watch the footage and decide for ourselves.
 

Animal Spies
Science & Technology
A baby langur monkey enters the wild, and other langur monkeys accept it into their group. But the baby monkey isn't actually a monkey at all. It's a remote-controlled, camera-equipped robot disguised as a monkey. And it's been sent into the wild to film langur monkeys up close, in their natural habitat.
The robotic monkey is one of 34 animatronic "Spy Creatures" created to infiltrate the animal world for a recent BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) documentary, Spy in the Wild.  Other Spy Creatures include a hippo, an orangutan, a tortoise, a baby crocodile and an African wild dog pup, better known as "Spy Pup".
Award-winning filmmaker John Downer is the film's producer. In fact, Downer created the concept of using "spy cameras" to film animal documentaries, which he calls "wildlife dramas". Downer's first spy-camera film came out in the year 2000. But Downer's original undercover robots weren't animals. They were inanimate objects, such as rocks or snowballs (depending on the environment in which the documentary was filmed). The first robotic animals were 13 sea animals created for Downer's 2014 film Spy in the Pod, a documentary capturing amazing behaviors of dolphins.
The animatronic Spy Creatures created for Spy in the Wild, however, are the most sophisticated Spy Creatures yet. Aside from having high-definition cameras hidden in their eyes, they are extremely lifelike. They look like their animal counterparts, move like them, smell like them, and make the same sounds. Because they're so lifelike, the Spy Creatures are more likely to be accepted by the real animals, and able to interact with them. Spy Pup, for example, wags its tail, twitches its ears, and bows submissively.
Spy in the Wild, a movie in four parts, brings viewers into the lives of over 30 animals around the world.  To film the documentary, film crews traveled with their Spy Creatures to 31 countries, collecting 8,000 hours (11 months) of footage. The film took three years to produce.
The Spy in the Wild series investigates the similarities between animals and humans, and explores such topics as whether or not animals express friendship or love. Thanks to the extraordinary photography of the undercover animals, we can watch the unique footage and decide for ourselves.





Have you ever dreamed of flying like a bird? Yves (EEv) Rossy had that dream. Today, Rossy flies through the air on a special wing he designed himself. It's a jet-propelled wing that lets him shoot through the sky like a jet plane. People call him "Jetman"!
Rossy's wing is made out of carbon and fiberglass, and has a seven-foot wingspan. Rossy attaches the wing to his back with a harness, and four kerosene-powered jet engines propel him through the air. Rossy wears a motorcycle-like helmet to protect his head and face during flights.
After reaching a high altitude on a helicopter or airplane, Rossy turns on his wing's engines with a small controller in his hand, and jumps from the plane. Rossy steers the wing by moving his body in different ways - like a skier. He uses his body to change direction while flying. When he's ready to land, he uses the controller to turn off the engines. Then, he opens a parachute and glides back down to solid ground.
Rossy flew jets for the Swiss Air Force before becoming a commercial pilot, but he always longed for a different type of flying experience. He wanted to have more "contact with the elements".  Searching for that "contact", Rossy tried many air sports, including hang gliding and sky surfing.
More than 20 years ago, Rossy began working in his garage, designing a wing to help him fly like a bird. The first wing he created, in 2002, wasn't rigid enough - so Rossy tried again, and kept trying. With help from the aerospace companies JetCat and ACT Composites, he continued building prototypes (more than fifteen), testing and improving the design. Finally, in 2006, Rossy became the first person in history to fly with a jet-propelled wing, when he flew over Bex, Switzerland. Back then, his flight lasted five minutes and forty seconds. Now he can fly for around 10 minutes.  In 2009, Rossy became Jetman, full-time.
Rossy's wing has enabled him to soar across the Grand Canyon, around Mt. Fuji, and over the Swiss Alps. Today, Rossy flies with a partner, Vince Reffet. We'll have to wait and see where the Jetmen's wings will carry them next!

It's a Bird, It's a Plane... It's Jetman!
Science & Technology
Would you like to fly like a jet plane? Yves (EEv) Rossy actually does! Rossy created a wing with jet engines. They send him shooting through the sky. That's why people call him Jetman!
Rossy invented a carbon and fiberglass wing. The wing's four jet engines let Rossy fly at high speeds. Straps keep the large wing in place on Rossy's back. Rossy also wears a helmet to protect his head and face.
 
When Rossy wants to fly, a pilot takes him up in an airplane or helicopter. Then, Rossy turns on the wing's engines, and jumps into the air. Rossy uses his body to steer while flying. When he's ready to land, he uses a special controller to turn off the engines. Then, he opens a parachute and returns down to the ground.
Rossy has been a pilot for many years. He flew both military and commercial airplanes. But Rossy felt cooped-up inside the airplane. He wanted to fly outside "with the elements". So Rossy began designing a special wing. He finished it in 2002, but, it didn't work correctly. So Rossy tried again. He continued building, testing and improving his design. Finally, in 2006, Rossy became the first person in history to fly with a jet-propelled wing. His flight lasted five minutes and forty seconds. Now, Rossy can fly for around ten minutes.
Since 2006, Rossy has flown in many different places around the world. He has flown across the Grand Canyon, around Mt. Fuji, and over the Swiss Alps. Today, Rossy flies with a partner, Vince Reffet. We'll have to wait and see where the Jetmen's wings will carry them next!

Look! Up in the sky! It's not a bird. It's not a plane. It's Yves Rossy! Yves (EEv) Rossy made a special wing. The wing lets him fly in the air. The wing has engines. They let Rossy fly fast - like a jet plane. Because Rossy flies like a jet, people call him "Jetman".
When Rossy was a young boy, he dreamed about flying. When he grew up, he worked as a pilot. But Rossy didn't want to stay inside an airplane. He wanted to fly outside, in the air.
Rossy invented a large wing. He made the wing out of a strong, hard material. Rossy put four jet engines on his wing, for speed. When Rossy wants to fly, he straps the wing onto his back. He puts on a helmet. Another pilot takes him high up into the sky, in a helicopter. Then, he jumps into the air. He starts the engines, and flies.
Today, Rossy flies with a partner, Vince Reffet. Rossy and Reffet fly in skies around the world!





Making paper is bad for the environment. To make paper, we cut down millions of trees. We use lots of water and energy. We use chemicals to make the paper white. These chemicals pollute the air. It's time to try a new kind of paper - stone paper!
We make stone paper out of stones and resin. Resin is a sticky material that comes from plants and trees. We make stone paper in special factories. Factory workers turn stones into powder. They mix the stone powder with hot resin. The hot resin sticks the powder together.
Stone paper is naturally white, so the factories don't need to use chemicals. Stone paper is waterproof, so the rain won't ruin it. It is also hard to tear.
Stone paper looks a lot like regular paper. But stone paper has a small amount of plastic in it. So, you recycle stone paper with plastic, not with paper.
In ancient times, people wrote on stone. Let's write on stone again!

Save Trees! Use Stone Paper!
Science & Technology
The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) says people in the USA use about 69 million tons of paper each year. This is terrible for the environment. Half of the trees in the world that are cut down are used to manufacture paper. Lots of water and energy are used, too. And bleach - also bad for the environment - is used to whiten paper. But now there's a new kind of paper. It's not made from trees and water, and manufacturing it uses less energy. This paper is made from stone!
To make stone paper, calcium carbonate stones are crushed and turned into powder. Then, the powder is mixed with hot resin. Resin is a sticky material that comes from plants and trees; it's often used to make plastic and glue. Then, the flat paper is turned into big rolls.
Stone paper is waterproof, so if the paper gets wet, it won't get ruined. It's also very strong, and hard to tear. And since stone paper is naturally white, no bleach is needed.
Stone paper is also recyclable, but the resin mixed with the stone powder contains plastic, so stone paper must be recycled with plastic - not with paper. This could be confusing for some people, and might cause stone paper products to be recycled incorrectly. Also, even though stone paper decomposes, it can take up to eight months for it to decompose completely.
Yet, many say that stone paper is still more eco-friendly than traditional paper. So, get your hands on stone paper, and see what it's like to write on rock!

Save Trees! Use Stone Paper!
Science & Technology
Did you know half of the trees in the world that are cut down are used to manufacture paper? And an EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) report says that about 69 million tons of paper are used per year - just in the USA. That's a lot of trees! But now, there's a new kind of paper that's not made from trees. It's called stone paper. As its name suggests, it's made from stone!
Unlike wood pulp used in traditional paper, stone paper's main component is the mineral calcium carbonate. In manufacturing stone paper, calcium carbonate stones are pulverized, and mixed with hot resin. Then, the flat paper is wound into big rolls.
Traditional paper production uses a huge amount of water, a limited natural resource. But stone paper doesn't require any water at all. Traditional paper is treated with bleach (which is bad for the environment) to make the paper white. Stone paper is naturally white.
Stone paper and traditional paper may look similar, but they feel different. Stone paper is smoother. It's also waterproof, oil-resistant, and strong; it's even hard to tear. Stone paper is insect-resistant too (insects won't eat it), so it's useful for preserving important documents.
The technology to manufacture stone paper has been available for decades, but the production really started to take off in the 21st century as demands for "green" products increased. Today, stone paper is starting to gain popularity in Europe and the USA. Although it costs 20 percent more than traditional paper, you can buy stone paper notebooks, gift bags, and coffee cups.
However, not everyone is excited about stone paper. The resin inside it contains plastic. So, although the paper is recyclable, it needs to be recycled with plastic, not paper. Some people say this is confusing, and worry that it'll cause stone paper products to be recycled incorrectly. They also say that while stone paper is photodegradable (it breaks down when exposed to sunlight), it takes too long - up to eight months - to degrade completely.
Yet, even with its drawbacks, many people choose stone paper because it's still more eco-friendly than traditional paper.
In ancient times, people wrote on stone. Today, you can almost do the same - write on stone paper!




Put Down Your Phone
Science & Technology
Do you ever feel like you spend more time looking at your smartphone than anything - or anyone - else? Many people feel a need to always be available online, 24 hours a day. But when excessive smartphone use starts negatively affecting people's health, work, and social lives, it's time for a "digital detox".  Doing a digital detox means reducing, or completely stopping, the use of digital technology, including smartphones, computers, and tablets.
There are people who use their devices constantly - at work, in their cars, in restaurants, and even in bed. According to a 2015 report from the Bank of America, more than 50 percent of American adults check their smartphone at least every five to ten minutes. This type of behavior could be a sign of addiction.
"Abusing and sometimes compulsively using our smartphones can be a real problem," says Dr. David Greenfield, the founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction. As people become more reliant on their devices, their brains get used to high levels of the chemical dopamine. When they're not using their devices they feel panic and experience withdrawal symptoms, just like with other addictions.
Start a digital detox by turning off the notifications on your devices, so you won't hear beeps when text messages come in or social media alerts pop up. Next, choose a specific time of day to check your messages. You may also want to put your device somewhere where you can't see it, so you won't be tempted to check it as often. A detox can be as long (and as intense) as you choose. For people who think their smartphone is taking over their lives, Greenfield suggests a detox of at least three days.
Psychologist Dr. Yvonne Thomas says that a digital detox helps people "feel more rested, more aware, more present, more productive and less overwhelmed and stressed out." Today, there are special camps and retreats where adults can go to detox - no devices allowed! There are even smartphone apps that measure your smartphone use, and alert you when it's time to take a break. Are you ready to "unplug" your brain, and start a digital detox?

Many people are online almost the entire day. But using a smartphone or other digital technology too much isn't healthy. What's the solution? A "digital detox". A digital detox is a period of time in which you use less digital technology. Some people stop using smartphones, computers, and tablets completely.
According to a 2015 report from the Bank of America, more than half of US adults check their smartphones every five to ten minutes, at least. This behavior could be a sign of addiction. Dr. David Greenfield started the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction. He explains that as people use their devices more regularly, their brains get used to higher levels of the chemical dopamine. So, when they can't use their devices, they feel panic and other symptoms of withdrawal.
Dr. Greenfield recommends a detox of at least three days for people who are addicted. But a detox can be as long as you choose. You can start with small steps. Turn off your device notifications, so beeps from text messages or apps won't tempt you to look at your phone. Then put your smartphone out of sight, so you won't be tempted to take a peek. Choose one time of day to check your messages.
There are also smartphone apps that can help. They keep track of your smartphone use, and let you know when it's time for a break. There are even camps for adults, where no digital devices are allowed.
Psychologist Dr. Yvonne Thomas says that a digital detox helps people feel more rested, aware, present, productive and less stressed. Are you ready for a digital detox?

Many people are addicted to their smartphones. When they can't use their phones, they feel terrible. These people need a "digital detox".
A digital detox is a time to rest from technology. You choose a certain amount of time. It can be a day, or a few days. During this time, you use less technology.
To start, turn off the notifications on your phone, so your phone won't beep. Then, put your phone away. When you can't see or hear your phone, it's easier to forget about it. Check your messages just once a day.
Dr. David Greenfield is an expert in technology addiction. He says that people with smartphone addiction shouldn't use technology at all for three days or more. Some people go to digital detox camps. At camp you do many fun activities. But you can't use phones, computers, or other digital devices.
Taking a break from technology makes people feel healthier and more relaxed. Is it time for your digital detox?




Your Own Personal Translator
Science & Technology
Do you like to travel? Traveling around the world can be difficult if you don't speak other languages. Now, there is something that can help - the 'Pilot'.
The Pilot is a small piece of plastic you put in your ear. It's a translator. How does it work? First, each speaker puts the  Pilot earpiece in their ear. Then, one person speaks. A small microphone inside the Pilot sends the words to a smartphone. The smartphone uses a special app to translate the words. Then, the other speaker hears the words in their own language, through their earpiece.
Andrew Ochoa developed the Pilot. He got the idea when he wanted to speak with a French woman. But he didn't speak French and she didn't speak English.
The Pilot's price is around $200 dollars for two earpieces. It translates English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. In the future, the Pilot will translate more languages. Next time you travel, bring the Pilot!

How would you ask someone for directions in a foreign country? What if you didn't speak the language? People often encounter language barriers when traveling. But now, there is a device that can help. It's called the 'Pilot'.
The Pilot is the world's first wireless earpiece that translates language. Andrew Ochoa is the CEO and co-founder of Waverly Labs, the company that developed the Pilot. Ochoa, a native English speaker, got the idea because he wanted to speak with a French woman. She didn't speak English and he didn't speak French.
The Pilot translates a conversation as two people are speaking. Each person puts the Pilot earpiece in their ear. Then, one person begins speaking. The Pilot's microphone picks up the sound. The words are translated through a smartphone app. The other speaker hears the translation in their ear. There are a few seconds of delay on the translation. Also, the Pilot's translations are not always 100% accurate. Ochoa says the Pilot will improve as more people use it.
The Pilot comes in different colors, and costs around $200 dollars for two earpieces. It translates English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. More languages will be added in the future. The Pilot can even work if one of the people doesn't have an earpiece. They can use the app and listen to the translation over the smartphone's speaker.
Ochoa says that the Pilot can give the global community the gift of "a life untethered, free of language barriers," and it's all thanks to the Pilot.

Do you enjoy traveling to different countries? Language barriers can often make exploring foreign countries challenging. For example, how can you order food or find your hotel if you don't speak the local language? Language barriers may even discourage people from visiting certain places. But now, there is a small but powerful device that can help. Some people call it "the gadget straight out of science fiction." This gadget is called the 'Pilot'.
The Pilot is the world's first wireless earpiece that translates language. Andrew Ochoa is the CEO and co-founder of Waverly Labs, the company that developed the Pilot. Ochoa, who is a native English speaker, got the idea for the Pilot when he met a French woman he wanted to communicate with (who later became his girlfriend).
The Pilot doesn't translate random bits of language. Instead, it translates a conversation as it's spoken, in real time. How? Each person puts the plastic Pilot earpiece in their ear. Then, one person begins to speak. The Pilot's microphone picks up the sound, and the words are translated through a smartphone app. The other speaker can hear the translation in their ear. There are a few seconds of delay on the translation, but Waverly Labs is working to decrease the delay. Also, the Pilot's translations are not currently 100% perfect, but they will improve as more people use the Pilot. It comes in different colors, and costs around $200 dollars for two rechargeable earpieces.
The Pilot can currently translate English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. Waverly Labs will be adding more languages to the Pilot in the near future. The Pilot can also work in multilingual conversations. Even if one of the people speaking doesn't have an earpiece, they can use the app. Translation can be heard over a smartphone's speaker. This can be helpful in conference calls, if more than two languages are being spoken.
Ochoa says that the Pilot can give the global community the gift of "a life untethered, free of language barriers." In the future, you will be able to converse with almost anyone in the world, thanks to the Pilot!





Have you ever wanted to climb to the top of a high mountain, or scuba dive deep in the ocean? With virtual reality (VR), you can do this and more -  while sitting in your seat. Just put on your headset!
Watching a movie using VR technology makes you feel like you're in the movie. You see everything in 3-D and you can see all around you - all 360 degrees. No matter where you turn your head, you get a different view, just like in real life.
VR technology has been used in the world of gaming for a long time. But as this technology gets better and cheaper, people are finding many other uses for VR. They're making VR music videos and VR commercials. And now, VR filmmakers are getting into the action, too.
Several big-name directors, including Steven Spielberg, are developing "top-secret" VR projects. And the famous Cannes Film Festival recently added a special VR pavilion, where they showed short VR films. In Amsterdam, you'll find the first VR movie theater in the world, The VR Cinema. In The VR Cinema, the audience doesn't sit in rows of connected seats facing a screen. They sit in individual seats that swivel around. And they wear VR headsets and headphones. Unlike other movie theaters, which show full-length feature films, The VR Cinema shows a series of short films.
Some filmmakers think VR is the future of the movie industry. Others disagree. They say that while they've succeeded in making short VR films, full-length VR films are still a challenge. The difficulty in creating full-length VR movies lies in the viewers' freedom to look wherever they choose. In traditional movies, the director dictates where the viewer's focus will be. But how does the director tell a story when each viewer is looking in a different direction? How do they keep all viewers focused on the plot?
This leads to the ultimate question. Will VR be relegated to the world of ads, promos, and other short film experiences? Or will filmmakers learn to develop a new style of film that fits the VR format? Only time will tell.
In the meantime, strap on a headset and check out VR movies for yourself!

Virtual Reality in Film
Science & Technology
Have you heard of virtual reality (VR)? When you put on a VR headset you feel like you're inside a movie. In the past, VR technology was used mostly in video games. But today, filmmakers and filmgoers are also exploring VR technology.
The world's first VR movie theater is in Amsterdam, Holland. The VR Cinema is not like regular theaters. You don't sit in rows of seats in front of a huge screen to watch one long movie. You watch a few short VR movies, while sitting in chairs that swivel around. Everyone wears a special headset, which allows them to see the movie in 3-D. No matter where you turn in your chair, you will see another part of the movie setting.
Film festivals are also beginning to show VR films. The 2016 Cannes Film Festival has recently opened a special section just for short VR films.
But while filmmakers are making short VR films, full-length VR films are still a challenge. In regular full-length films, directors control what viewers see. They decide what the focus of the movie will be. But with VR, viewers can look wherever they want. How can directors tell a story when viewers are looking in all different directions? And how do they keep each viewer focused on the plot?
Because of this challenge, some filmmakers think that VR won't work with full-length films. Others disagree. They say filmmakers will learn to make a new kind of movie that fits the VR format. Who's right? Only time will tell.
  
Until then, put on a VR headset, and see what you think!

Virtual Reality in Film
Science & Technology
Do you play virtual reality (VR) video games? VR technology makes you feel like you're inside the game. Today, filmmakers are using VR in new ways - to make VR movies.
To watch a VR movie, you wear a special headset. Look inside the headset, and you see a 3-D picture. Turn your head to the right, and you see the right side of the picture. Turn to the left, and you see the left side. Everything looks so real. You feel like you're inside the movie.
The VR Cinema in Amsterdam is the first VR movie theater in the world. The VR Cinema is not like other theaters. It doesn't have a big screen. Instead, everyone wears a headset. They sit on chairs that swivel, so they can turn right, left, or all around. In The VR Cinema you watch a few short films - not one long film.
Will all movies become VR movies? Some filmmakers say yes; some say no. Put on a VR headset and see what you think!




Mirrors Bring Sunshine to a Small Town
Science & Technology
Rjukan is a small town in Norway. From September to March, Rjukan doesn't get sunlight. Why? The town is in a valley. A mountain blocks the sun. Sunlight is important - it helps keep people healthy. Martin Andersen lives in Rjukan. He wanted to bring some sunlight to the town.
In 2005, Andersen started the Solspeil project. Solspeil means "sun mirror." Andersen wanted to use mirrors to reflect the sun's rays into Rjukan. But, not everyone in Rjukan liked Andersen's idea. People thought the mirrors were too expensive. In the end, sponsors paid for the project and the town council agreed.
Finally, in 2013, a helicopter put three very large mirrors onto the mountain across from Rjukan. Now, the mirrors reflect the sunlight into Rjukan's central square.
Anette Oien also lives in Rjukan. She didn't like Andersen's idea in the beginning. But now, Oien is starting to like the Solspeil. "I miss the sun here in winter," Oien says. "It can be so hard. This is the light I long for," she says while standing in the sun.

Mirrors Bring Sunshine to a Small Town
Science & Technology
Rjukan is a small town in the Vestfjord Valley in Norway. After Martin Andersen moved to the town, he noticed that by the end of September, the sun disappears from Rjukan. The Gaustatoppen Mountain next to the town blocks out the sun. Sunlight doesn't return to the town until March! Sunlight is important for people's health, so Andersen decided to help - with mirrors!
Andersen wasn't the first person to try to solve the sunlight problem in Rjukan. In 1913, Rjukan's founder, Sam Eyde, wanted to use mirrors to bring sunlight into the town. But Eyde's plan didn't work, because the technology wasn't available yet. Instead, a cable car was built for people to get to the top of the mountain to enjoy some sunlight.
In 2005, Andersen started the Solspeil project, which means "sun mirror." He wanted to use large mirrors to reflect light down into Rjukan. Not everyone in Rjukan thought the mirrors were a good idea. Many thought the project would be too expensive. Andersen finally raised enough money for the project with help from sponsors. Eventually, the Rjukan town council agreed to let Andersen start the project.
In 2013, a helicopter was used to install three mirrors on a mountain opposite Rjukan. Each mirror is 183 square feet and reflects sunlight into Rjukan's central square. Computers adjust the position of the mirrors in order to follow the sun.
Even those who doubted the project, like Anette Oien, now come to enjoy the sunshine. "I miss the sun here in winter terribly," Oien says. "It can be so hard. This is the light I long for."

Mirrors Bring Sunshine to a Small Town
Science & Technology
In the summer of 2001, artist Martin Andersen moved to Rjukan, Norway. Rjukan is a small town located at the bottom of the narrow Vestfjord Valley. Andersen noticed that by the end of September, the sun disappears from Rjukan. From September until March, the 1,800-meter-high Gaustatoppen Mountain blocks the sun from reaching the town. Without enough sunlight, people's physical and mental health can suffer. Andersen decided to solve this problem. How did he do it? With mirrors!
Andersen wasn't the first one to try to solve the sunlight problem in Rjukan. In 1913, Sam Eyde, the town's founder, wanted to use mirrors to bring sunlight into Rjukan. Unfortunately, he wasn't successful because the right technology hadn't been invented - yet. Instead, a cable car (which still runs today) was built in 1928 to take residents up the mountain to soak up some sunlight.
In 2005, Andersen started the Solspeil project (which means "sun mirror"), and started looking for funding. However, not everyone in Rjukan thought the mirrors were a good idea. "When I came up with the idea, there was a lot of skepticism," Andersen says. Many people thought the project was a waste of money - some even protested on social media. But Andersen was determined. Andersen found sponsors to help fund the Solspeil project - the final price tag was more than $830,000. After discussing the project for five years, the Rjukan town council finally agreed to install the mirrors.
In 2013, with the help of a helicopter, three large mirrors were installed on top of a mountain opposite Rjukan. The mirrors were placed 450 meters above the base of the mountain. Each mirror is 183 square feet and reflects sunlight into Rjukan's central square. Computers control the mirrors, which are programmed to automatically adjust their position to follow the sun.
Even those who weren't sure about the project, like Anette Oien, now come outside to enjoy the sunshine. "I miss the sun here in winter terribly," Oien says. "It can be so hard. This is the light I long for."




It's a Bird, It's a Plane It's...the Internet!
Science & Technology
Two-thirds of the world's population does not have Internet access. Why? Sometimes there aren't enough cell towers to provide the Internet to people who live in remote places. Technology companies have found solutions to this problem - in the sky! They're using satellites and balloons to connect more people to the Internet.
Project Loon uses balloons to bring the Internet to these hard-to-reach areas. In 2013, Project Loon tested their balloons in New Zealand. The balloons have also been used in Australia, Brazil, and Sri Lanka. In 2015, Project Loon decided to bring the balloons to Indonesia. Why? The people there are scattered among 17,000 islands. This makes it difficult and expensive to bring the Internet to Indonesia using traditional methods (through wires and land-based cell towers). "Indonesia is the perfect fit for Project Loon," said Mike Cassidy, Loon's project leader.
The plastic balloons act as "floating cell towers" - 20,000 meters in the air! They're 12 meters tall and filled with helium. Each "loon" has an antenna which transmits the Internet. People on the ground control the balloons to make sure they bring the Internet to remote areas. Each balloon can provide Internet access to an area of about 40 kilometers and lasts for about 100 days.
Spacecom is another company bringing the Internet to people in remote areas. Spacecom's Amos-6 satellite will stay in orbit over the continent of Africa and beam the Internet down into remote areas. The satellite will bring people low-cost Internet access through local service providers. Large parts of West, East, and Southern Africa will access the Internet through the Amos-6 satellite. Spacecom's head of sales for Africa, Amir Carmelli, says the company will provide the latest and best satellite technology "so that African people can easily communicate through the Internet."
There are many benefits to bringing the Internet to billions of people around the world. For example, children who live far away from schools will be able to study online. Medical advice will be available online for people without local doctors, and businesses in remote areas will be able to make even more money selling and advertising their products online. The sky's the limit!

Many rural and hard-to-reach areas of the world don't have the Internet. This is because there aren't many cell towers in these areas. Technology companies have finally found solutions to this problem - in the sky!
For example, a company called Project Loon has created special plastic balloons. When filled with helium, the balloons act as "floating cell towers" - 20,000 meters in the air! Each "loon" has an antenna which connects people to the Internet. People on the ground control the balloons. Each balloon can provide Internet access to an area of about 40 kilometers. The balloons have been used in Australia, Brazil, and Sri Lanka - and now Indonesia. Indonesians live among 17,000 different islands. This makes it difficult and expensive to bring the Internet to Indonesia the traditional way (through wires and land-based cell towers). "Indonesia is the perfect fit for Project Loon," said Mike Cassidy, Loon's project leader.
Spacecom is another company working on bringing the Internet to people in remote areas. Spacecom's Amos-6 satellite will float above the continent of Africa. Large parts of West, East, and Southern Africa will access the Internet through the satellite. The satellite beams the Internet down into remote areas. Once the Amos-6 satellite is working, people will be able to get the Internet at a low cost through local service providers.
Having access to the Internet has many benefits for people in remote areas. For example, students that live far away from schools and universities can study online. Also, people without local doctors could get medical advice online. Businesses could make even more money selling their products online. When it comes to the Internet...the sky's the limit!

Science & Technology
Did you know that billions of people around the world can't get the Internet? They live in places that don't have the basic systems the Internet needs to work. Technology companies found solutions to this problem...in the sky!
Project Loon wants to help. Indonesia is a country of 17,000 islands. It is difficult to bring the Internet to all the islands. Project Loon makes plastic balloons that float 20,000 meters up into the sky. Each balloon is a "floating cell tower." One balloon can bring the Internet to an area of 40 kilometers.
Spacecom is a technology communications company. Their Amos-6 satellite can bring the Internet to people in African countries. The Amos-6 satellite floats over Africa in Space. Many people in Africa live very far away from cities. It is difficult for them to get the Internet. With the satellite, more people in many African countries will be able to get online.
Balloons and satellites will bring the Internet to people who need it. The sky's the limit!





NASA is not ready to send people to the planet Mars, yet. To help get ready, NASA scientists built a dome on a pretend "Mars" in Hawaii, USA. They call it HI-SEAS.

On HI-SEAS, scientists will learn how people might behave on planet Mars. There are three men and three women living in the dome. The crew will live on HI-SEAS for one year.

The dome is small - only 36 feet by 20 feet. Each person has a small bedroom and a desk. They share a kitchen, a dining room, and two bathrooms. There is no phone in the dome, but there is a computer to send e-mails. NASA scientists will watch the crew and see how they work as a team. How will they solve problems? Will they argue? Will they feel sad? What will they do when they're bored? 
It will take NASA time until they can send people to Mars. Meanwhile, they can learn ways to make the long trip better - on HI-SEAS!

Welcome to Mars, USA!
Science & Technology
Have you ever thought about living on the planet Mars? Well, as part of an experiment for NASA, three men and three women are living on a simulated "Mars", called HI-SEAS, in Hawaii, USA. They will stay there for an entire year!

The purpose of the experiment is to study how the crew behaves. How will they work together as a team to solve problems? How will they handle conflict? How will they cope being so far away from home? NASA will use the information they learn from this experiment to help a future Mars mission succeed.

The HI-SEAS crew will be living in a small dome - only 36 feet by 20 feet. There is a kitchen, a dining and exercise area, and two bathrooms. Each HI-SEAS crew member has a very small bedroom and a desk.

On HI-SEAS, crew members will have experiences like the ones they would have on Mars. For example, the water on HI-SEAS is rationed. On a real Mars mission, the crew will need to bring with them all the water they'll need. They won't be able to get more water during the mission. There is no telephone in the dome, but there is a computer so that crew members can send e-mail. However, just like on Mars, e-mails will only arrive 20 minutes after being sent.

The information NASA learns will help them plan the first human mission to Mars. One lesson that crew member Kim Binsted has already learned is "that you really can't prevent interpersonal conflicts." People will have to learn to live together in a small space - on Mars, USA, and beyond.

Welcome to Mars, USA!
Science & Technology
In August 2015, three men and three women entered a dome, in Hawaii, USA, where they will spend the next year. They'll be cut off from the rest of the world, living on a simulated "Mars", called HI- SEAS. If you too had this opportunity, would you take it?
The HI-SEAS habitat is a dome built on top of a dormant volcano in Hawaii. This location was chosen because the area surrounding the volcano is very isolated and looks similar to Mars. The landscape is rugged; there aren't any other humans, and there are very few plants and insects.
The crew consists of four scientists, a pilot, and an architect. They are part of an experiment for NASA, which is collecting information for a future mission to Mars. The purpose of the experiment is to study the crew's behavior - how they get along, solve conflicts, and work together as a team. They plan to use the information to help a future Mars mission succeed.

The dome is 36 feet by 20 feet. Each person has a tiny bedroom and a desk. However, most of the space in the dome is shared in order to simulate the living situation on Mars. The crew shares a kitchen, a dining room, and an exercise area. Although there are two bathrooms, water is very scarce. Each person gets only eight minutes of shower time a week! Why? On a real Mars mission, all water will be brought from Earth and rationed. So on HI-SEAS, water is rationed as well. Crew members can keep in touch with the outside world by e-mail only. However, just like there will be on Mars, the Internet connection has a 20 minute time lag.

The information NASA learns will surely help plan the first human mission to Mars. One lesson that crew member Kim Binsted has already learned is "that you really can't prevent interpersonal conflicts." People will have to learn to live together in a small space - on Mars, USA, and beyond.




Quiet, Please!
Environment
"I sit and close my eyes. I can't hear a single human sound. It feels amazing," writes science journalist Jenny Morber. Morber visited a special area of Olympic National Park in Washington, US, known as "one square inch of silence" (6.45 square centimeters). It's one of the quietest places in the US.
At the start of the COVID-19 crisis, national parks around the world closed. Now, they're starting to reopen. But as humans return to the parks, so does the noise - and experts are concerned. Research has shown that too much noise is stressful and bad for our health. It raises blood pressure and increases the risk of illness.
Noise affects animals, too. In a 2017 study, scientists at Colorado State University found that "human-made" noise in protected areas interfered with endangered species' well-being. Human-made noise can include anything from music and conversation to motorboats and plane flyovers. These loud noises mask sounds that help animals find food, stay safe, and socialize.
At the start of the pandemic and for months after, shipping traffic in the oceans decreased, resulting in quieter waters. Wildlife biologists in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park started keeping a close eye on humpback whales, observing the positive effects of living in a quieter ocean.
Quiet Parks International (QPI) is an organization trying to stop noise pollution and preserve naturally quiet places. In 2014, they certified Zabalo River, in Ecuador's Amazon rainforest, as their first Wilderness Quiet Park. QPI identifies quiet areas across the globe that need protecting. So far, they have identified over 262 sites.
On Earth Day, in 2005, QPI's cofounder Gordon Hempton, an acoustic ecologist, placed a symbol of this noise control project - a tiny red stone - on the "one square inch of silence." Hempton chose a spot where you can experience at least 15 minutes of non-human-made sound. On that spot you hear a diverse, natural soundscape of singing birds and a roaring river. Hempton believes that if you can protect one square inch of silence, you can eventually protect one thousand square miles. Hempton says that in the modern world, silence is on the verge of extinction. "I don't know if I can save silence," he says, "but I know that I can try."

Quiet, Please!
Environment
When was the last time you heard nothing - no cars, digital devices, nor human voices? There is a spot in Washington's Olympic National Park where you can experience 15 minutes of natural silence. Gordon Hempton, an acoustic ecologist found the spot, deep in the park's forest. He placed a tiny red stone there as a symbol of the importance of silence; the spot is known as "one square inch of silence" (6.45 square centimeters).
At the start of the COVID-19 crisis, national parks around the world closed; as a result, they became much quieter places. Now, parks are starting to reopen. But as visitors return, so does the noise. And research has shown that too much noise is bad for a person's health. It raises blood pressure and increases the risk of illness.
"Human-made" noise affects animals, too. In a 2017 study, scientists at Colorado State University found that human-made noise can hurt endangered species. Human-made noise can include anything from planes and motorboats, to music and conversation. When nature gets noisy, animals can't hear the important natural sounds that help them find food, or stay safe from predators.
Hempton is the cofounder of Quiet Parks International (QPI). The organization wants to stop noise pollution and protect naturally quiet places. To raise awareness, QPI identifies quiet areas across the globe. So far, they've identified over 262 sites. In 2014, the Zabalo River in Ecuador became QPI's first Wilderness Quiet Park. Hempton believes that natural silence could become extinct. "I don't know if I can save silence," he says, "but I know that I can try."

Quiet, Please!
Environment
During the COVID-19 lockdown, national parks closed. The parks became very quiet. Now, national parks are opening again. They are getting noisy again, too. Cars, planes, and people's voices make parks noisy. They cause noise pollution.
Noise pollution can make you sick. Noise pollution is bad for animals, too. Animals need to hear certain natural sounds to survive. But noise pollution hides these natural sounds.
Gordon Hempton studies silence. He wants to protect quiet places. Hempton found one of the quietest spots in the US. It's in Olympic National Park, in Washington, US. This spot is called "one square inch of silence" (6.45 square centimeters). At this spot, you hear only natural sounds for 15 minutes. Hempton marked the spot with a tiny red stone.
Hempton also started a group that fights noise pollution. It's called Quiet Parks International (QPI). QPI finds quiet areas in national parks around the world. So far, they found more than 262 sites in countries such as Spain and Jordan. Hempton and QPI are working hard to save silence.





Barcelona, Spain, is a big city. It has problems with cars, noise, and air pollution. This is not healthy for people in Barcelona. The government wanted to do something. So, they made "superblocks."
What is a superblock? It's a special area in the city. One superblock has nine square blocks. There are homes and businesses in the superblock. There are parks and playgrounds, too. There is colorful art everywhere! You see people walking and cycling. But you don't see a lot of cars.
Cars can drive around the superblock. But inside the superblock, cars must drive very, very slowly. That's why a superblock is a good place to walk or ride a bicycle.
Today, Barcelona has six superblocks. And the government is planning hundreds more! Researchers say that superblocks are healthy places to live. Why? Because there isn't a lot of noise or air pollution. People enjoy living on superblocks, too. Carles Pe�a lives on a superblock. He says, "When I wake up, I now hear birds instead of traffic."

Living on a Superblock
Environment
Poblenou is a neighborhood in Barcelona, Spain. Like most of the city, it was very noisy and had a lot of air pollution. Poblenou wasn't a healthy place to live or raise a family. But city officials wanted to change that. So, in 2017, they created the first "superblock" in Poblenou.
A superblock, or a superille in Spanish, is a nine-square-block area with almost no traffic. Instead of driving through the superblock, cars go around it. Only residents' cars and emergency vehicles may drive on the streets, and cars drive slowly - at only 10 kilometers per hour!
What is the Poblenou superblock like? It has homes and businesses. People walk and ride bicycles down the streets. Friends meet at the many caf�s, parks, and playgrounds. There are a lot of benches to sit on, too. There are also colorful games painted on the sidewalks for children to play on. And artwork decorates the streets.
 
Becoming a superblock has made Poblenou a more enjoyable place to live. But that's not all. Researchers studied life on a superblock, and they found that living in a superblock is good for people's health. Why? Superblock residents walk more. In addition, there is less noise and air pollution in a superblock.
Today, Barcelona has six superblocks and is planning hundreds more. Other countries are interested in superblocks too. Seattle, USA, and Melbourne, Australia, are thinking about the idea. "This street used to be filled with four lanes of traffic. Now it is just for people and parks. When I wake up, I now hear birds instead of traffic," says Poblenou resident Carles Pe�a.

Living on a Superblock
Environment
The Poblenou neighborhood in Barcelona, Spain, used to be a typical, large urban center. With few parks, and high levels of air and noise pollution, it wasn't a healthy place to live or raise a family. That's when the city's officials stepped in. They decided to try an innovative approach to improving the quality of life in their city. In 2017, Barcelona created the first in a series of planned "superblocks."
Called a superille in Spanish, a superblock includes a nine-square-block area that is closed to regular traffic. Only residents' cars and emergency vehicles are allowed to drive on the streets, and cars have a 10-kilometer-per-hour speed limit. Pedestrians and cyclists rule the superblock!
Imagine a neighborhood that is a mix of homes and business areas. People walk and cycle down the streets. Some sip coffee and chat with friends at one of the dozens of neighborhood caf�s. Others congregate in parks and playgrounds. Laughing children play on colorful games that are painted on the sidewalks. Streets are lined with plenty of places to sit, and decorated with sculptures and other works of art. Traffic runs around the 400-meter area of the superblock, not through it.
However, the benefits to living in a superblock go beyond an enjoyable afternoon stroll through car-free streets. Recently, researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health did a study on the superblock model. It showed that life inside a superblock is actually good for the residents' health. Because there is less noise and air pollution, and people get a lot of physical activity, the Institute predicts that life expectancy will increase.
Today, Barcelona has six superblocks and plans on creating hundreds more. The idea is so exciting that it has other countries interested. City officials in Seattle, Washington, USA, want to create a superblock in a six-block area. And officials in Melbourne, Australia, are exploring ways superblocks could make their city safer for pedestrians. As for the Poblenou superblock, resident Carles Pe�a feels the change has been a positive one. According to Pe�a, "This street used to be filled with four lanes of traffic. Now it is just for people and parks. When I wake up, I now hear birds instead of traffic."




Home Under a Dome
Environment
Ingrid and Benjamin Hjertef�lger, a couple from Norway, believe in living a sustainable, vegan lifestyle. So, they decided to build a special kind of house called an eco house, designed to have as little impact on the environment as possible. The house, covered by a glass dome, is in the Arctic Circle - one of the coldest places on Earth.
In 2013, the Hjertef�lgers and their children moved into their house in Sandhorn�ya, a small island in Norway. The family built their three-level, five-bedroom house themselves from wood and "cob" - a mixture of sand, clay, and straw - made into bricks. Outside, a dome of 360 glass panels covers the house and garden, sheltering the area from the harsh weather (with temperatures as low as minus 11 degrees Celsius). The dome also acts as a greenhouse for the garden where the family grows a lot of their own food, including tomatoes, kiwis, cucumbers, and melons. Under the dome, the Hjertef�lgers can grow food for five months longer than if they were to plant outside the dome. The dome is expected to last for 100 years, and the cob structure will last forever, if kept dry.
Although the Hjertef�lgers spent about $400,000 to build their home, they are able to save money because of its sustainable design. They compost food scraps, and use a system that turns wastewater into fertilizer for the garden, instead of dumping it into the ocean. Solar panels use energy from the sun to power the house, and a wood-burning stove keeps the house warm during the long winters.
The inside of the Hjertef�lgers' house is quite cozy. The plaster walls are decorated with stones collected from the beach, recycled bottles, and tiles. "Being inside the house is relaxing," says Benjamin. "There are many who tell us that when they visit, they feel a certain calmness." The unique location of the Hjertef�lgers' home gives them a perfect view of the northern lights each winter.
The Hjertef�lgers offer places for people to stay, tour the area, and learn about sustainable living. Through hosting workshops on vegan cooking, meditation, and building with cob, the Hjertef�lgers hope to inspire more people to build eco homes.

Today, many people want more eco-friendly lives. Ingrid and Benjamin Hjertef�lger believe in sustainable living. So, they decided to build an eco house. An eco house is built in such a way that it doesn't hurt the environment.
In 2013, the Hjertef�lgers and their children moved into their five-bedroom eco house in Sandhorn�ya, Norway. Sandhorn�ya is in the Arctic Circle. The family built the house themselves from wood and "cob". Cob is sand, clay, and straw mixed together. A huge dome, made of 360 glass panels, covers the house. The dome protects the house and garden from the cold weather - temperatures can get as low as minus 11 degrees Celsius. The dome also creates a greenhouse for the garden. The vegan family grows a lot of their own food, including tomatoes, kiwis, cucumbers, and melons. Inside, the walls are decorated with stones from the beach, and recycled bottles. "Being inside the house is relaxing," says Benjamin. "There are many who tell us that when they visit, they feel a certain calmness."
The Hjertef�lgers spent about $400,000 to build their eco house. But the house saves them money. It has a system in which the water from the sinks and toilets gets reused for the garden. The Hjertef�lgers use solar panels, which use energy from the sun to power their house. The family also composts the food they don't need anymore. During the long winters, all the family needs to heat their home is a wood-burning stove.
The Hjertef�lgers have places for visitors to stay on their land. They offer tours and classes. They hope to inspire people to live more eco-friendly lives.

The dome is a greenhouse for the Hjertf�lgers' garden. The family is vegan - all their food comes from plants. They grow a lot of fruits and vegetables. For example, they grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and melons. The water from the family's sinks and toilets goes into their garden. They also compost food. This helps their garden - and the environment.
It's very cold in Sandhorn�ya. The dome also keeps the Hjertef�lgers warm during the winter. The house uses energy from the sun to make electricity. The family also uses a wood-burning stove to keep warm.
The Hjertef�lgers want people to visit and learn about helping the environment.





Do you go jogging to get exercise? Now, you can also go "plogging". With plogging you can jog and clean up the Earth.
The word plogging is a combination of the words "pick up" and "jogging". How does plogging work? You put on your running shoes and start jogging. While you jog, you pick up trash on the ground. You bring a bag for the trash you find. You wear gloves to keep your hands clean. Plogging makes your legs and arms stronger. Plogging also uses more energy than jogging.
Erik Ahlstr�m started the sport of plogging in Sweden in 2016. Today, there are plogging groups in more than 40 countries such as India, Russia, Ecuador, and Thailand. Ploggers (people who go plogging) put pictures on the Internet of the trash they find. This helps more people learn about plogging.
Do you have a plogging group in your city? Maybe you could start one.

Do You Want to Go Plogging?
Environment
Some people jog to stay healthy, and some do it just for fun. Now, there is another reason to jog. You can run and help the environment at the same time with "plogging". The word plogging combines the word jogging with plocka upp (to pick up in Swedish).  Ploggers wear gloves and take trash bags with them while they jog. As they run, they collect litter they find.
Ploggers get a great workout. Picking up trash makes your leg and stomach muscles stronger. Carrying heavy bags of trash makes your arm muscles stronger. Plogging also burns more calories than normal jogging.
Erik Ahlstr�m invented plogging in Sweden in 2016. Whenever he went bike riding, he saw a lot of litter and it bothered him. "The same debris could remain in the road for several weeks without anyone picking it up, so I started picking it up. It felt good in my heart to clean up even a small place," remembers Ahlstr�m. Other joggers began joining Ahlstr�m, and the new trend of plogging spread quickly. Then ploggers began posting pictures of themselves on social media. Plogging spread around the world to places such as India, Russia, Ecuador, and Thailand. Today, ploggers from over 40 countries are part of the online plogging community. School running clubs also go plogging. Many clubs have competitions with prizes for the heaviest bag of trash.  
There are more than 60,000 photos of people plogging on Instagram. These photos help raise awareness of the Earth's growing trash problem. So, if your town doesn't have a plogging group, start your own! Just put on your running shoes, take a trash bag and gloves, and start plogging!

People go jogging for many reasons. Some people run to train for a sport, others run to improve their health and fitness. Now, there's another reason to jog. You can run and help the environment at the same time with "plogging", also called "eco-friendly running". The term plogging combines the word jogging with plocka upp, a Swedish expression meaning to pick up. Ploggers are joggers who equip themselves with gloves and trash bags, and collect any litter they find while jogging.
While cleaning up, ploggers also get a great workout. Picking up trash from the ground helps strengthen leg and stomach muscles and increases flexibility. Carrying those heavy bags of trash makes arm muscles stronger. It's no surprise that more calories are burned through one hour of plogging than with normal jogging.
Erik Ahlstr�m invented plogging in Sweden in 2016. Whenever he went bike riding through Stockholm, he noticed an alarming amount of trash and this bothered him. "The same debris could remain in the road for several weeks without anyone picking it up, so I started picking it up. It felt good in my heart to clean up even a small place," remembers Ahlstr�m.
Eventually, other joggers joined Ahlstr�m on his daily runs, and the new fitness trend of plogging spread quickly throughout Sweden as groups of runners gathered for plogging events. Ploggers began posting pictures of themselves on social media, and the trend spread around the world to places such as India, Russia, Ecuador, and Thailand. Through his group Plogga, Ahlstr�m now has a whole team of ploggers. Today, ploggers from over 40 countries are part of the online plogging community. School running clubs also plog, and many have members compete to see who can collect the heaviest bag of trash.  
On the photo-sharing app Instagram you can find more than 60,000 photos of people plogging! By posting pictures of the trash they find, ploggers help raise awareness of the Earth's growing trash problem. So, if there isn't a plogging group in your town, start your own! Just put on your running shoes, grab a bag and gloves, and start plogging!




Zero Waste Life
Environment
Look around your home and you'll probably find many items in paper and plastic packaging - most of which will end up in landfills. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on average, Americans discard approximately 2 kg of trash per day per person. Some people - concerned about the effect all this trash has on our environment - have decided to drastically reduce the amount of trash they throw away. These individuals are part of the "zero waste" movement.
Bea Johnson founded the zero waste movement in 2013. With her blog and book Zero Waste Home, she has inspired thousands of people worldwide to explore zero waste living. Johnson sums up zero waste in the five R's: "Refuse what you do not need. Reduce what you do need. Reuse what you consume. Recycle what you cannot refuse, reduce or reuse, and Rot (compost) the rest." Since beginning her journey in 2008, Johnson has reduced her family's annual trash to fit into a one-liter jar! How does she do it? She takes glass containers to a bulk store to fill with dry goods or liquid items, and makes her own cloth bags to carry things like groceries. These are just two of the many ways she works to achieve zero waste.
Lauren Singer, another zero waste blogger, doesn't even have a garbage can in her New York (USA) apartment! Like Johnson, any small amount of trash that doesn't fit the "five R's" goes into a jar. In Singer's blog, Trash is for Tossers, she includes zero waste tips, such as a recipe for homemade toothpaste. Singer explains how to combine baking soda, coconut oil, and peppermint oil to clean your teeth (with a compostable bamboo toothbrush). This eliminates the need for non-recyclable toothpaste tubes, and saves money.
Kathryn Kellogg also has a blog to educate people on the zero waste lifestyle. On Going Zero Waste, readers can take the 31-day zero waste challenge. It includes simple, daily changes people can make, such as making chemical-free cleaning products, and buying second-hand clothing.
Johnson says the zero waste lifestyle is "about making simple swaps and finding a balance that works for you." What do you think? Could you live a zero waste lifestyle?

Do you buy many items in paper and plastic packaging? People in the U.S throw away around 2 kg of trash per person each day. Most of this waste goes into landfills. So, some people have decided to greatly reduce their trash. They are part of the "zero waste" movement.
Bea Johnson founded the zero waste movement in 2013. Her blog and book, Zero Waste Home, inspired thousands of people worldwide to try zero waste living. Johnson sums up zero waste in the five R's: "Refuse what you do not need. Reduce what you do need. Reuse what you consume. Recycle what you cannot refuse, reduce or reuse, and Rot (compost) the rest." Since 2008, Johnson's family has needed only a one-liter jar to store their yearly trash! One of the many ways she reduces waste is by making her own cloth bags to carry things. Johnson also shops at stores where she can fill up her reusable glass containers with liquids and dry goods.
Lauren Singer, also has a zero waste blog, Trash is for Tossers. Singer doesn't even own a garbage can! On her blog, Singer has a video explaining how to make toothpaste using baking soda, coconut oil, and peppermint oil. This way, there are no toothpaste tubes to throw away.
On another blog, Going Zero Waste, blogger Kathryn Kellogg invites readers to take a 31-day zero waste challenge. It includes simple, daily changes people can make, such as shopping with reusable bags, making chemical-free cleaning products, and buying second-hand clothing.
Could zero waste living work for you?

Zero Waste Life
Environment
When we buy products, they usually come in packages. We use the products and throw the packages away. The packages go into landfills. This is bad for the environment. So, some people are trying to live a "zero waste" life. They are making less trash.
Bea Johnson has a famous blog and book called Zero Waste Home. There, Johnson tells people how to live a zero waste life. First, Johnson says to buy or use only what you need. Next, recycle or reuse packages and items (like clothing). She says to compost old food and other organic materials, and to make cloth bags to carry things. Johnson's family makes very little trash each year. All their trash fits into a small jar!
Lauren Singer also lives a zero waste life. She doesn't even have a garbage can at home! Singer has a zero waste blog, too. She teaches readers how to make toothpaste using natural ingredients. Now, they have no toothpaste tubes to throw away.

People all around the world love cute, black and white giant pandas. But there's a big problem. There aren't many pandas in the world anymore. People are afraid they will become extinct.
Pandas come from China. They live in forests and eat bamboo. Years ago, there was a lot of bamboo in China. But now, there aren't enough bamboo forests in China. The pandas need help.
People in China decided to plant more forests. Also, they opened nature reserves to keep the pandas safe. In the nature reserves, scientists tried many things to save the pandas. They started a special program to help pandas survive in the wild. In the program, mother pandas live with their young in special places in the nature reserve. The mothers teach the young pandas how to survive. When scientists think the young pandas are ready, they move them into the wild.
Today, there are more pandas than there were 50 years ago. This is all very good news for pandas.

Pandas Return to the Wild
Environment
The black and white giant panda lives high in the bamboo forests in China's mountains. These beautiful animals are in danger of becoming extinct because humans are destroying the forests where they live and the bamboo that they eat. To prevent this, the Chinese government created conservation programs and nature reserves to protect pandas and their bamboo homes. In fact, the government is spending about $255 million every year to save the pandas.
Today, about two-thirds of the world's wild pandas live in sixty-seven nature reserves in China. "If we don't help them, they'll be extinct within the next thirty to fifty years," says Zhang Hemin, deputy director of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda.
Experts say pandas need two things in order to survive in nature. They need to be able to find enough bamboo to eat. They also need to have their own territory, away from other pandas, because they don't like living in groups. And in order to survive as a species, pandas need to keep reproducing.
At the Wolong National Nature Reserve, pandas are bred by scientists. They live with their mothers in special areas of the reserve. The mothers train their young pandas to survive on their own. Once the young pandas are independent, they are released into the wild.
Although not all of the pandas from the Wolong National Nature Reserve have survived in the wild, China's conservation programs are having great success. Since the first nature reserves opened, the world's panda population has risen by 17%.

Pandas Return to the Wild
Environment
The black and white giant panda, a much-loved cultural icon of China, lives high in the bamboo forests in China's mountains. But giant pandas have been in danger of becoming extinct for years, as humans have destroyed bamboo forests, the panda's habitat. In response, the Chinese government has created conservation programs and nature reserves to try to protect pandas and their habitats - spending about $255 million each year on the effort. Currently, about two-thirds of the world's wild pandas live in sixty-seven nature reserves in China. "If we don't help them, they'll be extinct within the next thirty to fifty years," says Zhang Hemin, deputy director of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda.
Keeping pandas dependent on human care, however, is not a goal of conservation programs. Pandas must be able to survive in the wild. "That's why we are training the captive-bred pandas for release," explains Zhang.
Experts say pandas need two things in order to survive in nature. They need to be able to find enough bamboo � the main part of a panda's diet � for themselves. They also need to claim their own territory, away from other pandas, because pandas don't like to live in groups. And in order to survive as a species, pandas need to mate and reproduce.
China's Wolong National Nature Reserve is home to about 150 giant pandas and has successfully bred more than 60 panda cubs. It aims to provide pandas with all the abilities they need to survive in the wild. First, scientists breed pandas in captivity. Then, mother pandas train their cubs in semi-wild sections of land, teaching them survival skills. Once cubs are independent, they are released into protected areas and watched closely using radio collars. These are special bands the pandas wear around their necks that send information to scientists about their movements and behavior.
Although not all of the pandas have survived in the wild, these conservation programs are very successful. The first of China's nature reserves opened about forty years ago, and since then, the world's panda population has risen by 17%. In 2016, with more than 1,800 pandas living in the wild, their status improved from endangered to vulnerable.




Cleaning Up the Ocean - One Pound at a Time
Environment
Imagine trying to surf in an ocean polluted with trash. In Bali, Indonesia, hundreds of tons of plastic wash up on beaches each day. Despite daily efforts to clear the trash, more debris continues to wash up on shore. Witnessing the desperate state of Bali's beaches is what drove Alex Schulze and Andrew Cooper to launch the company 4Ocean. The company's goal is to help clean up the 8 million tons of plastic trash suffocating the world's oceans - one pound (.45 kilograms) at a time.
During a surfing vacation in Bali, in 2015, Schulze and Cooper watched how garbage got caught in fishermen's nets along with, or instead of, fish. This gave Schulze and Cooper an idea. What if they started a company that pays fishermen to catch trash rather than fish? That's how 4Ocean was born.
4Ocean sells bracelets made from recycled glass and plastic. Each bracelet is assembled by hand in Bali, and costs $20. 4Ocean promises that for each bracelet purchased, they will remove one pound of trash from the ocean. 4Ocean hires teams of full-time captains and crews to clean the oceans 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, thereby creating jobs. Another goal of the company is to create "New Global Economies"; since plastic collected from oceans can be used to create new products, ocean plastic now has value.
Since 2017, when 4Ocean was started, the company has removed over 1.7 million pounds of trash from oceans and coastlines. By January 2018, the company had acquired a fleet of seven trash-collecting boats.
The trash collected goes to the company's local warehouses in Florida, USA, and Bali, to be rinsed and sorted. Then, it's sent to recycling facilities. 4Oceans hosts cleanups in countries around the world, including Indonesia and Haiti. It also educates developing countries on the importance of recycling.
Today, 4Ocean sells other recycled items in addition to bracelets, such as reusable bags, and water bottles. Schulze and Cooper's next objective is to remove 10 million pounds of trash from the oceans. That's a lot of items to sell!

Imagine trying to surf on an ocean covered in trash. Each day, hundreds of tons of trash (mostly plastic) are removed from the beaches of Bali, Indonesia. But trash continues to wash up on shore. American entrepreneurs Alex Schulze and Andrew Cooper saw the terrible state of Bali's beaches firsthand. This inspired them to start the company 4Ocean. 4Ocean's goal is to help clean up the 8 million tons of trash polluting the world's oceans - one pound (.45 kilograms) at a time.
Schulze and Cooper first thought of the idea in 2015, when they were surfing in Bali. There, they saw how trash kept getting caught in fishermen's nets. This made Schulze and Cooper wonder. What if fishermen could be paid to gather trash from the ocean, rather than fish? In 2017, they started a company, 4Ocean, to do just that.
4Ocean sells bracelets made from recycled glass and plastic, and assembled in Bali. Bracelets cost $20. The money earned from sales is used to fund 4Ocean's cleanup efforts. For each bracelet purchased, 4Ocean promises to remove one pound of trash from the ocean.
The company pays full-time boat captains and crews to clean the oceans. They work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Collected trash goes to 4Ocean's warehouses to be rinsed and sorted. Then, it's sent to recycling facilities. In addition to hosting cleanups around the world in countries such as the USA, Indonesia, and Haiti, 4Ocean also educates people on the importance of recycling.
So far, 4Ocean has removed more than 1.7 million pounds of trash from oceans and coastlines. 4Ocean's next goal is to remove 10 million pounds more!

There are 8 million tons of trash floating in the world's oceans. Alex Schulze and Andrew Cooper are doing something about this.
In 2015, Schulze and Cooper were surfing in Bali, Indonesia. They saw trash in the ocean. Trash was even floating into fishermen's nets. This gave Schulze and Cooper an idea. They opened a company called 4Ocean. 4Ocean pays fishermen to take trash out of the ocean instead of fish.
To earn money, 4Ocean makes and sells bracelets. They make the bracelets from recycled glass and plastic. They sell the bracelets for 20 dollars. For each bracelet they sell, they clean up one pound (.45 kilograms) of trash. 4Ocean uses the money to pay cleanup crews. Crews bring the trash to 4Ocean's warehouses. There, the company washes and sorts the trash. Then, they bring the trash to recycling plants.
4Ocean has ocean cleanups in the USA, Indonesia, Haiti, and other countries. In 2017 and 2018, 4Ocean removed over 1.7 million pounds of trash. Next, they want to remove 10 million pounds of trash!





When you are at the beach, it looks like there is lots of sand! But the world is running out of sand. Builders use tons of sand to build concrete buildings. They take the sand from oceans, lakes and rivers to make concrete. This hurts the environment. Many animals need sand for their homes. Four university students in London, England, found a solution to the sand problem. They made a new building material. The students started a company called Finite.
The Finite team took sand from the desert. They made a special glue to mix with desert sand. Then, they made bricks with this mixture. Finite's bricks are just as strong as concrete bricks. Finite's bricks are also biodegradable. So Finite's bricks are better for the environment. Finite's bricks can also dry outside. They don't need to go into an oven, like concrete bricks do.
Finite is still testing their bricks. But the team believes that their bricks are a good solution to the world's sand crisis.

Just Another Brick In The Wall
Environment
Did you know that sand is one of the world's most valuable natural resources? It's used to make concrete for buildings. Making the world's cities bigger requires billions of tons of sand. The best type of sand for concrete comes from oceans, lakes, and rivers. But removing sand from these areas is bad for the environment. It destroys ecosystems, and this endangers wildlife. As the amount of sand in the world gets lower, people are searching for alternatives to concrete. After a lot of research and testing, four university students in London, England, invented a new building material. They started a company called Finite.
Although the Earth has a lot of desert sand, it couldn't be used for building - until now. The team at Finite invented a special substance which binds grains of desert sand together. They use this special substance mixed with desert sand to create bricks. Finite's bricks are just as strong as concrete bricks. There are other benefits to Finite's bricks. Concrete bricks have to be baked in an oven, but Finite's bricks can be dried outside. Also, Finite's material can be made into any shape. The material can also be colored - concrete cannot. Concrete is often put in landfills after structures are taken down. But Finite's material can be reused, and is also biodegradable.

Finite's material is still being tested for use in large construction projects. "We ultimately see us becoming an alternative to concrete," says Matteo Maccario, who co-founded Finite. The company's name, Finite, reminds us that the world does not have an infinite supply of sand.

Just Another Brick In The Wall
Environment
Sand is actually one of Earth's most valuable natural resources - second to water! To visitors at beaches everywhere it can seem that the grains of sand are infinite. However, as cities expand, the global construction industry will require billions of tons of sand, the main ingredient in concrete, to build structures where people live, learn, work, and play. Construction-grade sand is taken from oceans, rivers, and lakes around the world. Though this type of sand is ideal for construction, it damages the environment. For example, in India, mining sand from rivers endangers wildlife by destroying ecosystems.
As the world sand supply depletes, four students from the Royal College of Art and from Imperial College London in the United Kingdom have invented a new building material which uses the more plentiful desert sand, instead of the type found in oceans, lakes, and rivers. After a lot of research and testing, these students founded a company called Finite. Finite was able to find the perfect opportunity to develop an alternative building material.
 
"You can't use any old sand to make concrete," asserts British geologist Michael Welland. But the team at Finite has found a way to use desert sand, formerly considered useless for construction purposes. The Finite team invented a new substance which binds the grains of desert sand together, creating bricks which are just as strong as traditional bricks. Unlike concrete bricks, Finite's bricks don't have to be baked in a special oven, they can dry outside or at room temperature. Finite's material can also be molded into any shape, and, unlike concrete, it can be colored with natural dyes. Concrete often finds its way into landfills after structures are taken down. But Finite's reusable and biodegradable material has only half the carbon footprint of concrete.

Finite's material is still being tested for use in large construction projects, and their binding substance is still top secret. "We ultimately see us becoming an alternative to concrete," says Matteo Maccario, co-founder of Finite. The company's name, Finite, reminds us that there is not an infinite supply of this very precious commodity - sand.




How Dark Is Your Sky?
Environment
What can you see when you look up at the night sky? According to National Geographic magazine, 80% of the people in the USA can't see the Milky Way from where they live. But the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is trying to bring darkness (and stars) back to the night sky by raising awareness of light pollution. The IDA selected the town of Torrey in Utah, USA, as an "International Dark Sky Community". "The changes that Torrey made to its lighting have resulted in better visibility at night," said John Barentine, director of conservation for the IDA. "They stand as a really important example of this to other communities."
The IDA was created in 1988, "to preserve and protect the nighttime environment". The IDA wants to combat light pollution by encouraging communities to use environmentally-responsible outdoor lighting instead of older, harmful lighting. When an area has too much artificial light, there are consequences other than an invisible Milky Way. Besides wasting a lot of energy and money, artificial lighting can be dangerous to wildlife. For example, sea turtles need to get to the ocean after they hatch on the sand. But hatchlings often mistake artificial light for the naturally bright horizon - causing millions to die each year without making it to the ocean. Artificial light can also negatively affect humans. It can disrupt circadian rhythms, which may cause health problems such as depression, diabetes and obesity. Additionally, glare from artificial lighting can make driving at night more dangerous.
International Dark Sky Communities are dedicated to preserving the night sky. In order to earn this title, a community must pass quality outdoor lighting ordinances. To make them "dark-friendly", streetlights should be fully covered at the top, with all the light facing downward, so that no light shines up into the night sky. Lights should have frosted glass instead of clear glass, and the lightbulb should be hidden inside the streetlight. Communities must also educate their citizens on the negative impacts of artificial light.
So far, only 18 communities in the world have become International Dark Sky Communities. "Without individuals and associations working together, the last remaining dark areas on the planet could well disappear without anyone noticing," says Torrey resident Mary Bedingfield-Smith.

Did you know that 80% of people in the USA can't see the Milky Way from their homes? The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) wants to bring darkness back to the night sky. They want people to understand the dangers of light pollution.
The IDA's goal is to encourage communities to use environmentally-responsible outdoor lighting. Harmful artificial light wastes a lot of energy and money, and can be lethal to wildlife. For example, it can confuse sea turtles, who use the natural light from the horizon to find the ocean. Artificial light is also dangerous to humans. Light pollution changes circadian rhythms, the body's natural clock. This can cause health problems such as depression and diabetes. Strong artificial lighting also makes it difficult for drivers to see the road at night.
To receive the title of "International Dark Sky Community", a community must show dedication to preserving the night sky. Communities pass laws to make outdoor lighting "dark-friendly. For example, streetlights must be covered at the top, and have frosted glass instead of clear glass. Lighting must face the ground, rather than up into the night sky. Additionally, lightbulbs must be hidden from view inside the streetlight.
The IDA has selected the town of Torrey in Utah, USA as one of only 18 "International Dark Sky Communities" in the world. Torrey resident Mary Bedingfield-Smith believes in people and associations like the IDA working together. If they don't, the last dark areas on the planet might disappear without anyone noticing.

How Dark Is Your Sky?
Environment
How many stars can you see at night? Many people can't see any stars. Why? Towns and cities have a lot of streetlights. Streetlights shine artificial light up into the night sky. Too much light makes it hard to see the stars. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) wants to keep night skies dark. Less artificial light means people will be able to see more stars at night.
The IDA chose the town of Torrey in Utah, USA as one of 18 "International Dark Sky Communities". People in the town learned why light pollution is bad for humans. Too much artificial light makes it hard for people to sleep. People get sick when they don't sleep enough. The community bought new streetlights. They have covers over the top. Now, light shines only on the ground - not up into the sky. Today, people in this town see thousands of stars at night.
In the future, the IDA hopes there will be many more International Dark Sky Communities.





Do you like energy drinks? Tyler Gage started an energy-drink company. The main ingredient in his drinks is leaves. The leaves come from the Amazon rain forest.
Gage traveled through the Amazon rain forest. He met different groups of indigenous people. He saw how these people live. Some groups wake up very early and make a special drink. They take leaves from the guayusa (gwhy-YOU-suh) tree. They put the leaves in water. Then they boil the water. The drink is healthy, and a little sweet. The drink has caffeine. Caffeine gives people energy. Gage tried the guayusa drink. It helped him focus.
Gage wanted more people to enjoy guayusa. He also wanted to help indigenous people in the Amazon earn a living. So Gage started a company called RUNA. The company makes energy drinks from guayusa leaves. RUNA buys the guayusa from farmers in the Amazon. Now, because of RUNA, about 3,000 farmers in the Amazon have work.
So say goodbye to coffee. And say hello to RUNA!

Goodbye Coffee, Hello RUNA
Environment
What drink has as much caffeine as coffee, keeps you healthy, and helps indigenous farmers in the Amazon? A RUNA energy drink!
Tyler Gage is a co-founder of the energy drink company RUNA. Gage found inspiration for RUNA on a trip to the Amazon rain forest during his college years. While living with different indigenous tribes, Gage observed a fascinating early-morning ceremony; everyone in the tribe gathered around a fire, enjoying a tea-like drink made from guayusa (gwhy-YOU-suh) leaves. As they drank, they told stories and discussed their dreams. The caffeine in the drink helped them focus on the day ahead. "The first time I drank it," says Gage, "it gave me a pretty good boost of energy." The guayusa drink is also naturally sweet, and has antioxidants, which are good for the body.
Gage decided to share guayusa with the rest of the world. When he returned to the USA, he and his friend, Daniel MacCombie, started RUNA, a company that produces a guayusa energy drink. They weren't only interested in profits, however. They also wanted to help indigenous communities in the Amazon earn a living.
Today, more than 3,000 farming families in Ecuador earn a living through RUNA. The farmers, members of the Kichwa tribe, grow guayusa in the Amazon rain forest and sell the plants to RUNA. Guayusa is the main ingredient in the energy drinks. RUNA got its name from the Kichwa people, who say drinking guayusa makes them feel runa, meaning "fully alive".
So, the next time you need a caffeine jolt, consider RUNA instead of coffee!

Goodbye Coffee, Hello RUNA
Environment
Would you like to start your day with a drink that has as much caffeine as coffee, is beneficial to your health, and helps indigenous farmers in the Amazon? Move over, coffee; RUNA energy drinks are here!
Tyler Gage, co-founder of the company RUNA, was inspired to start an energy drink business after spending time in South America. During his college years, Gage decided to take some time off and went to the Amazon rain forest. He traveled throughout South America, living with various indigenous tribes.
During his travels, Gage was intrigued by a morning ritual that some Amazonian tribes practice - drinking a tea-like liquid made from guayusa (gwhy-YOU-suh) leaves. Each day before dawn, the tribe gathers around a fire to brew guayusa leaves in large clay pots. While savoring their drinks, they tell myths and analyze dreams. The caffeine in the drink helps them think clearly and focus. "The first time I drank it, it gave me a pretty good boost of energy," says Gage. The naturally-sweet drink also has antioxidants, which help keep cells healthy. Gage loved the drink and wanted to share his discovery.
Gage returned to college and told his friend, Daniel MacCombie, about the drink. They decided to create a guayusa energy drink company that would also help indigenous people of the Amazon. "They really struggle to make money," says Tyler. "So we thought if we could use business as a way to support these communities, it could be a win-win situation." After graduation in 2009, Gage and MacCombie went to South America to make their dream a reality - and the company "RUNA" was born! The name comes from the indigenous Kichwa community in the Amazon region of Ecuador. They use the word runa, meaning "fully alive", to describe how guayusa makes them feel.
Guayusa is the main ingredient in RUNA energy drinks. The guayusa for RUNA's products is grown by Kichwa farmers. Raising and selling guayusa crops provides the farmers with a steady income. Today, more than 3,000 farming families in Ecuador grow guayusa in the rain forest.
So, the next time you need a caffeine jolt, consider guayusa instead of coffee!




Musical Vegetables

Have you ever wondered what a carrot ''sounds'' like? What about the melody of a tomato? At a special greenhouse in Tokyo, you can dance to the music of vegetables and learn about horticulture. As part of Tokyo's 2017 Design Touch event, a design company called PARTY created an interactive digital greenhouse, where you can touch seven different types of vegetables and experience the music and light show that follows.
The Design Touch event takes place annually and encourages visitors to enjoy design by using their senses. The unique installation in Tokyo, called Digital Vegetables, involves a combination of three senses: touch, sight, and sound. When visitors touch each of the seven types of vegetables, they set off a vegetable orchestra accompanied by a dazzling display of colored lights.
The vegetables are digitally programmed to emit their own specific sounds. "I recorded the sounds created with actual vegetables," explains Digital Vegetables' sound designer, Ray Kunimoto. He recorded, for example, the sounds seeds make when rubbed together, the sounds leaves make when touched, and the sounds fruits make when being eaten. Then he mixed these recordings with the sounds of various instruments.
A cabbage plays the deep sounds of an oboe, and a radish, the whistle of a flute. Pumpkins play the sounds of a clarinet. And eggplants emit the dreamy notes of a harp. A carrot sounds like a trumpet, the tomato a violin, and the sweet potato a piano.
The inviting music and light of this one-of-a-kind greenhouse attracts a range of visitors. The hope is that visitors will develop an appreciation and interest in the science and art of horticulture.
In today's fragile atmosphere, plants play an important role in restoring land that has been damaged by humans or natural events. They control erosion and help keep our air and water clean. And of course, plants and flowers beautify our neighborhoods and parks. PARTY has found a creative way for the plant life of greenhouses to not only feed us, help us breathe, and embellish our surroundings, but entertain us as well!

Forest Man of India
Environment
Jadav Payeng is from India. He lives on Majuli Island. Every year, the river near his home floods. When Payeng was 16 years old, he saw something terrible. The floodwaters carried hundreds of snakes to an area on Majuli Island. It was very hot in the area, and there were no trees. The snakes died in the sun.
Payeng was very sad. He decided to plant trees on the island. He dug holes with a stick, and planted saplings. The work was hard and he did it all by himself. Every day, Payeng collected saplings and seeds. Then, he planted them. After a few years, there was a small forest on the island.
Today, Payeng's forest has thousands of trees. It also has animals. Tigers, rhinoceroses, rabbits, deer, and birds live there. Elephants visit the island for a few months each year
Payeng received many awards for his work. People call him Forest Man of India. But Payeng's work is not over. "I will continue to plant until my last breath," he says.

Forest Man of India
Environment
One day in 1979, 16-year-old Jadav Payeng planted some trees. He planted them on a large barren piece of land on Majuli Island, in India. Day after day, he continued planting trees. Today, that barren piece of land is a forest. And Payeng, now in his fifties, planted it singlehandedly.
Majuli Island is on the Brahmputra River. Every year, the Brahmputra floods. In 1979, the floods washed hundreds of snakes onto a sandy part of the island. There were no trees to protect the snakes from the hot sun, so they died. When Payeng saw the dead snakes, he was very sad. He wanted to make the island safe for snakes and other animals, so he decided to plant trees.
First, he planted bamboo saplings, which people in a nearby village gave him. Using a stick, Payeng dug holes in the hard, dry sand, and placed the saplings in the holes. Each day, Payeng collected and planted more saplings and seeds. Eventually, Payeng was able to get seeds from the trees that he grew.
Today, Payeng's forest is bigger than New York's famous Central Park, and has more than 100 different kinds of trees. Animals live there, too. Tigers, rhinoceroses, rabbits, deer, and birds have made the forest their home. A herd of elephants visits each year for several months.
Payeng has received many awards for his work, and former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam named him Forest Man of India. But Payeng's work is not over. "I will continue to plant until my last breath," he says.

Forest Man of India
Environment
In a remote region of India, on Majuli Island, Jadav "Molai" Payeng has done something remarkable. He has taken a wasteland and singlehandedly turned it into a huge, green forest.
It all began in 1979 when 16-year-old Payeng was walking on Majuli Island, along the Brahmputra River, after a flood. The Brahmputra often floods the island, but this time Payeng saw something unusual. The flood had washed hundreds of snakes onto a barren sandbar. Not long after, when Payeng returned to the spot, he saw that the snakes were dead. With no trees to protect them, they had died in the sun. Young Payeng was very upset, and took action.
He started by planting bamboo saplings, which people in a nearby village had given him. Bamboo grows fast, and it can grow in sand. Its tall grasses make a good home for snakes and other animals. Payeng used a stick to dig holes in the hard, dry sand, and he planted the saplings in the holes. It was hard, time-consuming work.
Payeng continued planting every day. He planted saplings of different kinds, which he collected from villagers. He found seeds that the Brahmputra had washed up onto shore. And eventually, he was able to get seeds from the trees that he'd planted.
Today, Payeng's forest - called Molai Forest, in Payeng's honor - has over 100 types of trees. At 550 hectares in size, it's larger than New York's famous Central Park. Wild animals such as Bengal tigers, Indian rhinoceroses, rabbits, and deer have made Molai Forest their home. A herd of elephants visits the forest for several months each year, and vultures have come back to the area after 40 years.

Molai Forest is also good for the land. Floods from the Brahmputra wear away the island in a process called erosion. Majuli Island is 70% smaller than it was 100 years ago, and it continues to shrink. But forests, like Molai, help prevent erosion.
Payeng has received many awards for his accomplishments, and he was named Forest Man of India by former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Payeng's work, however, is not over. He has many more trees to plant. "I will continue to plant until my last breath," he says.




The Repair Cafe
Environment
What should you do when your desk lamp or blender breaks? Throw it away and get a new one? No! Take it to a Repair Cafe!

At a Repair Cafe you can get your broken items fixed for free by skilled volunteers. Items may include electrical appliances, bicycles, furniture, clothes, toys, instruments - as long as you can carry it in on your own.

But there's a catch: "Customers" can't just drop off their items and leave. They are expected to stay and watch their item being fixed, and maybe even assist in the repair. The goal is to show people how fun, rewarding, and easy the repair process can be, and encourage a repair culture instead of a disposable one.

Years ago, everyday items were built to last, and if an item broke, you'd fix it. Today, items are much cheaper - in price and quality - so they break more easily, and when they do, it's generally less expensive to buy a new one than to fix the broken one. But producing new goods uses energy and resources, and discarded items sit in landfills.

In response to this problem, environmental activist Martine Postma created the concept of the Repair Cafe. Her goals were to reduce waste, preserve and pass on knowledge of repair, and build community. She opened the first Repair Cafe in Amsterdam, in 2009. The project was so successful it spread throughout the Netherlands, and then throughout the world. Even if you have nothing to fix, you can go to a Repair Cafe for coffee and friendly conversation. Interestingly, the people getting repairs done aren't the only ones excited about this project; the volunteer fixers, or repair specialists, love it too; their numbers keep growing.

Repair Cafes aren't full-time fix-it shops. They're neighborhood gatherings held about once or twice a month in temporary venues. Some Repair Cafes ask people to let them know in advance what items they are bringing in, so the cafe will have the appropriate tools and repair specialists (e.g. electricians, tailors, carpenters) available.

Repair specialists are often older community members whose skills are seldom needed in today's disposable society. Repair Cafes aim to instill in people a respect not only for their items, but also for those who fix them.

What should you do when your lamp or blender breaks? Take it to a Repair Cafe.

At a Repair Cafe, skilled volunteers fix broken items. They fix electrical appliances, bicycles, furniture, clothes - almost anything, as long as it's small enough for a person to bring in on their own.

But Repair Cafes aren't stores. They're neighborhood gatherings held about once or twice a month in different places. And people don't drop off items and leave. They stay and watch their items being fixed; sometimes they help repair them. The job of the Repair Cafe is to show people how fun, rewarding, and easy repairing items can be. The idea is to get people to fix things instead of throwing them away.

Today, many items are not made well. They break easily. When an item breaks, it's usually less expensive to buy a new one than to fix it. But producing new items uses energy and resources, which is bad for the environment.

To help solve this problem, Martine Postma, an environmental activist, created the Repair Cafe. Postma wanted to get people to throw away less, teach people how to repair, and build community. She opened the first Repair Cafe in Amsterdam, in 2009. Today, there are Repair Cafes around the world. And the "customers" aren't the only ones who are happy with the project. The repair specialists, or fixers, love it, too.

Repair specialists are often older community members whose skills are rarely needed these days. Repair Cafes are an opportunity for these repair specialists to use their skills, and for other people to appreciate them.

The Repair Cafe
Environment
Your object breaks. What do you do? You take it to a Repair Cafe.

But a Repair Cafe is not a repair store. You can't leave your object there and come back for it later.

A Repair Cafe is a neighborhood gathering. People in the neighborhood bring broken objects. They bring in things they can carry, like furniture, appliances, toys, or clothes. Then they watch a "fixer" repair their object. When they watch, they learn how to fix their object. Fixers at Repair Cafes fix objects for free. These volunteers are repair experts.

When an object breaks, it usually costs more to fix it than to buy a new one. But making new objects is bad for the environment. Martine Postma made the first Repair Cafe. Her goal was to get people to fix objects and not throw them away. Postma's first Repair Cafe took place in Amsterdam, in 2009. Today, there are Repair Cafes around the world.





How much food do you waste? In Austin, Texas, people throw away 86 million kilograms of food each year. Some companies in Texas are trying to stop this.
Mokshika Sharma is the co-founder of a company called Full Fridge.  Sharma says many people buy food but don't have time to cook it, or don't know how to cook. Then the food goes bad, and they throw it away. What is Full Fridge's answer? They do the cooking! They make and deliver meals to people's homes.
Johnson's Backyard Garden (JBG) has a different answer. JBG is an organic farm. People give money to the farm. Then, they get a box with fruits, vegetables, and herbs. They also get instructions on how to keep the food fresh and how to cook it.
Compost Pedallers is another company. They collect food that people don't want, like old bread or fruit. Compost Pedallers brings these foods to farms. The farms use them for compost, to make good soil. Compost Pedallers fights food waste and helps farmers to grow more food.

Fighting Food Waste
Environment
In Austin, Texas more than 86 million kilograms of food goes to waste each year. Several companies in Texas are now trying to change this.
Mokshika Sharma, of the start-up Full Fridge, explains that many people buy fresh food and end up not eating it. They might not store the food properly, and it spoils quickly. Or they might not have time, or do not know how to cook the food. Whatever the reason, the food goes bad and ends up in the garbage. What is Full Fridge's solution? They do the cooking! They make and deliver meals to people's homes once a week. The deliveries include enough food for breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.
The CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) is a program at Johnson's Backyard Garden. It is an organic farm in Texas, and it has a different solution. People pay for 'shares' in the farm's harvest.  In return, they receive a box once a week. The box includes fresh produce, such as fruits, vegetables, and herbs. It also includes instructions on how to keep the produce fresh and recipes for each of the foods. 
The company Compost Pedallers also has a unique solution. The owner, Dustin Fedako, and his team bike to homes and office buildings. They collect waste that can be composted, such as leftover rice or old bread. They bring their collections (about 360 kilos worth) to farms and gardens. The farms and gardens compost these organic materials, turning them into soil for planting. Compost Pedallers reduces food waste and helps farmers grow good quality food.

Fighting Food Waste
Environment
In Austin, Texas more than 86 million kilograms (190 million pounds) of food goes to waste each year. That's equivalent to throwing away about $200 million! This reality has prompted several Austin companies to tackle the food waste problem.
A common reason food goes to waste is that people don't know how to properly store or cook the produce they buy. The CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program at Johnson's Backyard Garden, an organic farm in Texas, has a solution. People can join the CSA. As a member, they pay for 'shares' in the farm's harvest.  In return, they receive a box of farm-fresh seasonal produce once a week. They also receive storage instructions, cooking tips, and recipes for each fruit, vegetable, or herb that's in the box.  This system ensures a steady income for farmers and discourages waste among customers.
Full Fridge is a start-up that produces five-dollar packaged meals. Co-founder Mokshika Sharma explains that many people buy groceries with the intention of cooking their own meals. But due to lack of time or cooking ability, they don't do it. The food then spoils, and ends up in the garbage.  Full Fridge therefore provides these people with affordable nutritious meals.
Full Fridge menus include enticing options such as fruit and yogurt parfait for breakfast, zucchini and orzo salad for lunch, and chicken fricassee for dinner. Meals are delivered in bulk once a week. Containers can be recycled or returned to the company.
Composting is also a great way to prevent food waste. You collect leftovers from organic materials, such as fruit peels and egg shells, and use them to enrich the soil in order to grow plants. But many people don't have the time or energy to deal with their own composting. That's where Compost Pedallers steps in. Owner Dustin Fedako and his team bike to homes and office buildings collecting compost materials - from leftover rice to stale bread. They bring their collections (about 360 kilos worth) to local farms and gardens for use in their soil. So, while reducing food waste, Compost Pedallers also helps farmers produce good quality food.
Perhaps these new efforts will prompt people to think of creative ways to prevent food waste in their homes.




France Says "Adieu" (Goodbye) to Plastic
Environment
It's no secret that plastic harms the environment. Many countries around the world have begun to reduce their usage of plastic bags in stores. Plastic bags have been banned in Karnataka, India, San Francisco, California, USA, and France. And now, France is taking an even bigger step. According to the French Association of Health and Environment (ASEF), 4.73 billion single-use cups are thrown away in France each year. So lawmakers in France made the bold move of banning disposable plastic cups, plates, and silverware.
Plastic that isn't biodegradable - which is most plastic - damages the environment. French lawmakers hope that the ban, which will take effect in 2020, will help the environment. Manufacturing regular plastic uses a lot of energy. The law encourages companies who make plastic to use less energy, and create less waste. The hope is that the new law will also reduce the plastic litter in France.
The law states that all the single-use products available in France must be made using 50% organic materials. Additionally, the products must be suitable for people to compost at home, and not in industrial composting facilities. There are already some companies in the world that make products from organic materials. The company World Centric uses plant starch, wheat, and paper, but not all their products are recommended for home composters.
Advocates of the new law believe it will make France a leader in environmental progress. Some supporters want all non-biodegradable plastic gone as early as 2017. But not everyone agrees with the drastic steps France is taking to help the environment. Eamonn Bates is the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, which represents European companies who manufacture single-use plastic items including cups and plates. Bates says that the ban goes against European Union commerce rules, and he fears other European countries will follow France's lead. But while some people continue to debate France's ban, others think it will be an important step toward improving the environment.

It's no secret - plastic harms the environment. Many countries around the world are cutting down on how many disposable plastic bags stores give to customers. But bags are only part of the problem. According to the French Association of Health and Environment (ASEF), 4.73 billion disposable cups are thrown away each year in France. The French government has therefore decided to ban disposable plastic cups, plates, and silverware.
Most plastic doesn't biodegrade. And plastic that doesn't biodegrade harms the environment. According to the new French law, starting in 2020, if companies make disposable plastic cups, plates, or silverware, these products will have to be compostable. The products will also have to contain 50% organic materials.
Manufacturing regular plastic uses a lot of energy. The law should help companies who make plastic use less energy. The French government also hopes that through the law, plastic litter in France will be reduced. Some companies in the world already make disposable products from organic materials. One company, World Centric, uses plant starch, wheat, and paper.
Not everyone agrees with France's law. Eamonn Bates is the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, which represents European companies that manufacture single-use plastic items (including cups and plates). Bates says that the ban goes against European Union (EU) rules about how products are bought and sold in the EU. Bates is also afraid that other European countries will make similar laws. But while some people debate France's ban, others think it will be an important step toward improving the environment.

France Says "Adieu" (Goodbye) to Plastic
Environment
Plastic is bad for the environment. That's why people in many countries are trying to use less plastic. Recently, the government of France made a new law. Starting in 2020, businesses won't be able to make or sell disposable plastic cups, plates, or silverware.
Most plastic does not biodegrade. This means it will stay on the Earth as garbage, forever. That's why it's bad for the environment. With the new law, French companies will have to make special disposable products. These products will have to biodegrade.
Today, there is a lot of plastic litter in France. The government hopes that because of the law there will be less plastic litter. But not everyone agrees with France's law. Some people think it's not fair to businesses or consumers. They also say it won't help with the litter problem. Biodegradable plastic doesn't biodegrade right away. It takes a long time. But other people are ready to say "No" to disposable plastic, and "Yes" to the environment!




Fast Fashion
Lifestyle
Do you like wearing fashionable clothes? Some clothes look like expensive, designer clothes. But these clothes don't cost a lot of money. They are so cheap that people buy lots of them. Then, when the fashion changes, they throw the cheap clothes away. This is called "fast fashion".
Fast fashion makes a lot of waste. Waste is terrible for the environment. To make fast fashion clothes, companies use a lot of chemicals. Chemicals are bad for the environment, too.
That's why many people today want "slow fashion". Slow fashion companies use less chemicals to make their clothes. Slow fashion clothes also last longer. They are better quality than fast fashion clothes. Slow fashion clothes cost more money, so people wear them for longer; they don't quickly throw them away.
Slow fashion companies are trying to teach people about the bad effects of fast fashion. Hopefully, this will help slow fashion become popular.
Would you buy slow fashion clothes to help the environment?

Fast Fashion
Lifestyle
Today's fashion trends come and go quite quickly. But the fashion industry makes it easy to keep up with the latest runway looks with "fast fashion". Fast fashion means making and selling cheap clothing that looks very similar to expensive designer clothing.
Your average person can't afford the fashions they see on the runway. So, popular clothing companies create similar clothing that is cheap because it's lower quality. These clothes are so inexpensive that people often buy more than they need and throw the clothes away as soon as fashions change. This causes lots of waste, which is very bad for the environment.
 
Fast fashion harms the environment in other ways, too. Common fabrics used in making clothing are polyester and cotton. Polyester takes hundreds of years to decompose. And growing and dyeing cotton uses huge amounts of chemicals. In addition to making farmers ill, these chemicals pollute clean water.
Because of these and other ways fast fashion affects the environment, there is a growing demand for "slow fashion". Slow fashion means concentrating on quality rather than quantity, and making clothing in a sustainable way.
Many people have gotten used to buying fast fashion, throwing it away, then buying more. That's why the slow fashion industry needs to change people's habits if they want to succeed. Slow fashion companies have to teach people about the advantages of buying less and spending more for quality clothing that will last.
What do you think? Would you buy slow fashion to save the planet?

Lifestyle
Keeping your eye on fashion is no easy task, as trends come and go before you blink. But today's fashion industry makes it easy for consumers to keep up with the latest runway looks through "fast fashion", the practice of producing and selling cheap clothing modeled after the latest fashion trends.
Your average person can't afford the designer clothing they see on the runway. So, popular clothing companies create cheaper versions of these styles, in price and quality. They're so inexpensive, in fact, that people often buy more than they need, and dispose of last season's wardrobe when new fashions reach the market. So, while fast fashion might be convenient for consumers, it also causes lots of waste, which is very bad for the environment.
Fast fashion harms the environment in other ways, too. Common fabrics used in making clothing are polyester and cotton. Polyester takes hundreds of years to decompose, and is made using fossil fuels which pollute the air. To grow cotton, huge amounts of pesticides are used. These pesticides can poison farmers and they contaminate drinking water. Toxic dyes are often used to color fabrics, and the dyeing process pollutes clean water.
Because of these and other negative environmental effects of fast fashion, there is a growing demand for sustainable fashion, or "slow fashion". Slow fashion means creating better quality clothing in a sustainable way that lasts longer than fast fashion. It concentrates on quality rather than quantity.
In order for the slow fashion industry to become successful and replace fast fashion, consumers will need to get behind it. If consumers start demanding clothing that's made sustainably, major clothing brands will have to fulfill those demands.
But changing consumer habits is not easy. Today's consumers are used to getting new things and disposing of them when they are no longer wanted or needed. Slow fashion companies will need to educate consumers about how their clothes are made and where they usually end up, and the benefits of buying less and spending more for quality clothing that will last.

How Small Are These Books? Tiny!
Lifestyle
Do you enjoy reading books printed on paper? Nothing much had changed in the basic design of books in the last 500 years or so, until the introduction of electronic books, or e-books. Some experts predicted that e-books would make printed books obsolete. But so far, books are still being printed. "I haven't seen a new book format that I thought was at all interesting," says bestselling American author John Green, "but I find this format really usable and super-portable." Green is talking about an exciting innovation in publishing- printed books called Flipbacks.
Imagine a book that isn't much bigger than a smartphone. It fits in your hand or your pocket, and it doesn't weigh much, because its pages are made with special, very thin paper. The book has a horizontal shape. When you open it, the pages aren't side by side, they're one above and one below. So instead of turning the pages from right to left, you flip them upwards - almost like you change screens on a smartphone!
Some people complain that printed books are difficult to hold with one hand, and too big and heavy to carry around. But tiny, lightweight Flipbacks are designed for convenience - you can carry them in your handbag, pack them in your luggage for trips, and read them with just one hand while on public transportation.
Flipbacks were first introduced in the Netherlands, where they're called dwarsliggers. The word dwarsligger is Dutch for horizontal, and is also slang meaning "a person who thinks differently". Since hitting the market in 2009, Flipback books have spread through Europe - and now they've arrived in the USA. "I saw them, and I knew they would be just tremendous to have in the United States. They're so ingenious," says Julie Strauss-Gabel.  Strauss-Gabel is the president of Dutton Books for Young Readers, the first publisher to bring Flipbacks to the USA. Dutton Books recently published four of John Green's novels as a set of four tiny books. Green was excited when Strauss-Gabel suggested his books be the first to use the new format. "It didn't feel like a gimmick. It feels like an interesting, different way to read," says Green.

Printed books have had the same basic design for more than 500 years. After electronic books, or e-books, were invented, some people believed that printed books would disappear forever - but they haven't. Now, there is an exciting new kind of printed book called Flipbacks.
Flipbacks are about the same size as the average smartphone, so they fit comfortably in your hand or pocket. Flipbacks aren't very heavy because their pages are made with a very thin type of paper. When you open the book, the pages aren't side by side, they're one above and one below. And instead of turning the pages from right to left, you flip them upwards. Reading a Flipback almost feels like changing screens on a smartphone.
Some people feel printed books are too big and heavy to carry around all the time. Other people complain that they need to use both hands to hold a book. But tiny Flipbacks are quite small and convenient. Because they weigh much less than regular books, you can pack them in your luggage for long trips, and you can read them using just one hand while on public transportation.
Flipbacks - called dwarsliggers in Dutch - were first introduced in the Netherlands in 2009. The tiny books became popular in Europe, and now they've arrived in the USA. Dutton Books for Young Readers is the first publisher to bring Flipbacks to America. Recently, they published four of American author John Green's novels as a set of four Flipbacks.

You can also hold a Flipback in one hand. It's easy to read a tiny Flipback. Why? The pages aren't side by side. They are one above and one below. After you read a page, you flip it up to see the next one.
A Dutch company started making Flipbacks in 2009. Now, a US company is making them too. John Green is the first American author to have his books become Flipback books. Green is excited about Flipbacks. "It feels like an interesting, different way to read," he says.

Do you want to go to outer space? Orion Span is a start-up company. They are building the first hotel in space. The hotel is called Aurora Station.
Aurora Station will be 320 kilometers above planet Earth. It will look like a big tube. It will be about the size of a large private jet. There will be room for six people.  Before people come to Aurora Station, guests will learn about outer space and the spacecraft. They will also have to practice floating in space � just like real astronauts.
Space hotel guests will grow plants in space. They will also enjoy a special virtual reality room called a "holodeck". They will watch sixteen sunrises and sunsets each day!
To stay at Aurora Station for twelve days costs $9.5 million. That's a lot of money. But many people have already reserved their rooms! Orion Span will start building Aurora Station in 2019. They hope the hotel will be ready by 2022. Do you want to go on a space vacation?

Are you ready for a vacation � in space? Then, pack your space suit and visit Aurora Station, the first luxury hotel in space.
An aerospace company called Orion Span is developing Aurora Station. From the hotel, guests will watch sixteen sunrises and sunsets each day as they orbit 320 kilometers above planet Earth. Like real astronauts, they will do science experiments, such as growing food in space. They'll even get to take home what they grow. Guests will also enjoy a special virtual reality room called the "holodeck". The hotel will have Internet, so guests will be able to communicate with people on Earth.
Aurora Station will be shaped like a tube with room for up to six people (four passengers and two crew members). It will be 13.3 meters long and 4.3 meters wide � similar in size to a large private jet. All guests will start a special astronaut training program before they arrive at Aurora Station. They will learn about how a spacecraft works, and how to manage the feeling of weightlessness. Then, guests will spend around three hours a day finishing their training on Aurora Station. 
There are other companies designing space hotels. But Orion Span could be the first to open their hotel in outer space. Construction starts in 2019, and Orion Span hopes to launch the hotel into outer space by 2021. So, guests could be floating in space by 2022. Frank Bunger, the CEO of Orion Span, believes people will pay $9.5 million for a twelve-day vacation. And it seems he's correct � the company sold four months of reservations in just 72 hours. So, get ready for blast off...to a space vacation!

Orion Span promises travelers an "authentic astronaut experience" aboard Aurora Station as they orbit 320 kilometers above planet Earth. Besides spending two to three hours a day completing astronaut training, guests will enjoy sixteen sunrises and sunsets per day. Guests will also do science experiments such as growing food in space � and bring some back home. In addition to all these activities, Aurora Station's "holodeck" will provide virtual reality entertainment. Guests will be able to share their experiences with loved ones on Earth via high-speed Internet.
The tube-shaped hotel will hold six people (four guests and two crew members) and includes two suites (two guests per suite). The hotel will be 13.3 meters long and 4.3 meters wide, similar in size to a large private jet. Guests begin a three-month-long astronaut certification program before arrival. They complete it on board Aurora Station. Astronauts-in-training learn about subjects such as how a spacecraft works, and how to handle the feeling of weightlessness.
The twelve-day vacation costs $9.5 million per person. This might seem like a lot of money, but founder and CEO, Frank Bunger, doesn't think so. Other space tourists have paid $20 to $40 million dollars to visit the International Space Station. "Our goal is to make space travel even more affordable over time," says Bunger.
Construction on Aurora Station has already begun in Texas, USA, with an expected launch to outer space in a few years. Lucky guests could be enjoying their first night in space by the end of the decade. Bunger plans to expand the station to include "space condos" so people can own an apartment in space. People all over the world are excited to visit Aurora Station � Orion Span sold four months of reservations in just 72 hours!
Orion Span isn't the only company interested in space hotels. Axiom Space, Bigelow Aerospace and other companies are also designing space hotels and other projects. So, get ready for blast off...to a space vacation!




The World According to Instagram
Lifestyle
We live in a selfie society. People document their everyday lives by photographing the things they see and do. Then, they share them on social media, using apps like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram. With 800 million users, Instagram is the most popular app for photo sharing.
When Instagrammers post photos - whether of the beautiful plate of food set before them in a cafe, or an interesting sculpture in a museum -  they're sharing their experiences with the world. They're also providing free advertising for the businesses, organizations, and locations in their pictures. Some businesses have become famous from Instagram posts. Aware of this incredible opportunity, businesses and organizations are creating products, experiences, and spaces designed specifically for Instagram.
Restaurants are being designed to look cool on Instagram. They may have friendly messages printed on floor tiles, colorful wall paintings, funky tableware, and crazy food creations that people will want to photograph. These restaurants also have plenty of light, so pictures come out well, even if a darker room looks better in real life.
Designing for Instagram is happening everywhere - in stores and on city streets. Even museums are hosting Instagram-friendly exhibits. And some museums are being created with Instagram in mind. The Museum of Ice Cream (MOIC), for example, is a pop-up art museum of sorts that has appeared in several US cities. Inside are rooms with an ice cream theme, designed for playing, and taking selfies. There's a pool filled with colorful plastic sprinkles, and a swing that looks like a giant ice cream sandwich. MOIC has become a huge hit on Instagram, and, in turn, in real life.
The travel industry has been affected, too. Travel articles list "Instagram-worthy" sites around the world, turning them into popular tourist sites, and encouraging the creation of others like them.
But many people are against the "Instagramization of the world", as writer Emily Matchar calls it. People are so busy photographing their lives, they're not actually experiencing them. And, in making places Instagram-worthy, the places end up looking the same, and losing their individuality.
But like it or not, Instagramization is upon us. And, as well-known Instagrammer Patrick Janelle says, "These days, everything is experienced twice; first in real life, and second when we share it on social media."

We live in a selfie world. People take pictures of the many things they see and do. They post these pictures on social media, using apps like Instagram.
When you post photos on Instagram, you're sharing them with friends and you're advertising businesses. Post a great picture of a cafe, and people will probably go there.
To encourage Instagrammers to take selfies, companies are now designing their products and places to be more "Instagrammable". They're choosing designs that will make customers want to take selfies, and that will look good on Instagram. Restaurants, for example, might have creative wall paintings, unusual tableware, and crazy-looking foods. They'll also have lots of light, so photos come out well.
Some museums are choosing exhibits that look good on Instagram. And there are new museums being created especially for Instagram. The Museum of Ice Cream (MOIC) is a pop-up museum opening in several US cities. Inside are colorful rooms for people to play in and take selfies. There is a swimming pool filled with colorful plastic ice cream sprinkles, instead of water, and a giant ice cream sandwich swing. MOIC became a huge hit on Instagram, and a huge hit in real life.
Instagram has also influenced travel. Travel articles list "Instagram-worthy" places. These places then become popular tourist sites.
But many people are against "Instagramming" everything. They say people are too busy posting pictures to enjoy what they see. But Instagramming isn't about to stop. As Patrick Janelle, a popular Instagrammer says, "These days, everything is experienced twice; first in real life, and second when we share it on social media."

Companies want Instagrammers to take selfies at their stores, restaurants, or other businesses. So, they make their businesses look interesting and "Instagram-friendly".
Some Instagram-friendly restaurants have colorful drawings on the walls. Others make strange-looking foods. They put the foods in unusual dishes. An Instagram-friendly restaurant has lots of light, so photos come out well.
Some people are making special museums for Instagram. The Museum of Ice Cream (MOIC) has many different rooms with fun things to do. They have a pool with plastic ice cream sprinkles. They have a swing that looks like an ice cream sandwich. People take selfies in the rooms, and post them on Instagram.

On a hot summer day, it's fun to go to a splash park. That's a park where people play in sprinklers and other machines that spray water. And now, there's a new splash park.
Morgan's Inspiration Island is an accessible splash park. People with special needs can do everything in the park. The park is even free for children and adults with special needs. But the park isn't only for people with special needs. It's for everyone. A man named Gordon Hartman built the park. Hartman's daughter, Morgan, has special needs. Hartman wants people with and without special needs to come and play together.
At Morgan's Inspiration Island, big sculptures spray you with water. One play area has a pirate ship, and a bucket that pours water over your head. Rainbow Reef is an area with only warm water. It's for people who can't be in cold water. The park also has a boat ride that goes through a jungle.
Thanks to Hartman, people with and without special needs can now enjoy the summer together!

Lifestyle
A great thing to do on a hot summer day is go to a splash park. A splash park has sprinklers, fountains, and other devices that soak you with water!  And now, at Morgan's Inspiration Island, children and adults with special needs can go to a splash park, too.
Morgan's Inspiration Island, in San Antonio, Texas, USA, is the first accessible splash park. It was made especially for people with special needs. But the park is open to everyone. The goal of Morgan's Inspiration Island is for people with and without special needs to play together.
Gordon Hartman built the park. He named it Morgan's Inspiration Island for his daughter Morgan, who has special needs. He wanted to give Morgan the chance to play like other kids, along with other kids.
To build Inspiration Island, Hartman got help from water park experts, doctors, teachers, and parents. Together, they thought of ways to make the splash park comfortable and fun for its special needs visitors. This included having special waterproof wheelchairs for guests of the park.
Morgan's Inspiration Island has five water play areas, or splash pads, with different water activities. Shipwreck Island, for example, has a pirate ship, water cannons, a giant bucket that pours water, and a slide. Rainbow Reef is a special splash pad with warm water for people sensitive to cold water. The park also has a boat ride where visitors travel through a jungle.
Does it sound like fun? It is! At Morgan's Inspiration Island, you'll find people - with and without disabilities - laughing, playing, and enjoying the summer together.

Summer Fun for Everyone
Lifestyle
A great way to spend a hot summer day is at a splash park. That's a large outdoor park with sprinklers, fountains, and other devices that shoot, pour, and spray water. And now, with the opening of Morgan's Inspiration Island, people with disabilities can take part in the fun. Morgan's Inspiration Island, in San Antonio, Texas, USA, is the world's first completely accessible splash park. And people with special needs of any kind, no matter what age, get in free.
"Morgan's Inspiration Island promises to give individuals with physical or cognitive special needs a place where they can splash and play without barriers," says Gordon Hartman, who developed the park because of his daughter, Morgan, who has special needs.
Although the park was designed for people with disabilities, it's open to everyone. Morgan's Inspiration Island is a park of inclusion, where people with and without disabilities play alongside one another, and gain a better understanding of each other. It's also a chance for families with a special needs child, or parent, to play together.
Hartman worked with water park experts, doctors, therapists, special education teachers, parents, and caregivers to make the park safe and fun. They created five water play areas, or splash pads, with different water activities. Shipwreck Island, for example, has a pirate ship, water cannons, a tipping bucket, and water slide. Rainbow Reef, with its giant octopus, is a warm water splash pad for people who are sensitive to cold water. There is also a riverboat adventure ride that twists and turns through a jungle setting. The park even offers special waterproof wheelchairs.
Morgan's Inspiration Island is actually Hartman's second accessible park. His first was Morgan's Wonderland, which has a Ferris wheel, carousel, and other accessible rides. The idea to make parks of inclusion came to Hartman one day when he saw how kids at a swimming pool didn't want to play with Morgan because of her special needs. Right then and there, Hartman decided to find a way "to bring individuals together in a safe, colorful, inclusive environment devoid of barriers". Today, when you watch everyone laughing and shouting at Morgan's Inspiration Island and Morgan's Wonderland, it's clear that Hartman's dream became a reality.




DeafSpace
Lifestyle
Today, many buildings have ramps, which make them accessible to people who have difficulty climbing stairs. But did you know that ramps also help the Deaf?

Most deaf people communicate through sign language. When two people sign, they face each other to watch each other's hand movements. Even as they walk and sign, they look at each other instead of straight ahead. If they reach stairs, they have to stop their conversation and face forward, so they don't trip. With a ramp, they can keep walking and signing without interruption. This is something to keep in mind when creating DeafSpace.

DeafSpace is a kind of architecture that takes into account the needs of the Deaf and hard of hearing. Architect Hansel Bauman has been designing DeafSpace buildings for Gallaudet University, in Washington D.C., a university for the Deaf and hard of hearing.

Bauman and his team of Gallaudet professors and students are developing DeafSpace principles, guidelines for those designing DeafSpace. These principles are: space and proximity, sensory reach, mobility and proximity, light and color, and acoustics.

Space and proximity refers to the fact that deaf people benefit from spaces that allow them to sign comfortably with one another. An example of design based on this principle is putting round tables in a room (instead of rectangular ones), so everyone can see each other sign.

Placing mirrors in specific locations is an example of the sensory reach principle. Since deaf people can't hear footsteps, mirrors enable them to see when someone is behind them.

Ramps are an example of mobility and proximity, as are wide hallways, which allow two people to walk side-by-side while signing.

Deaf people often get eyestrain because they rely on their eyes to know what's going on around them. Soft lights and muted blue walls are easier on their eyes. This is an example of light and color.

Finally, acoustics deals with noise in a room. Some Deaf people wear hearing aids, which amplify sounds. As a result, something noisy, like an air conditioner, can be very disturbing. In DeafSpace, air conditioners are placed in locations in which they're less disturbing.

DeafSpace is not just helpful for the Deaf. Design elements such as soft light and less noise benefit everyone.

Gallaudet University, in Washington D.C., is a university for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Architect Hansel Bauman has been designing new Gallaudet buildings that make life easier for its students. Architecture that takes into account the needs of the Deaf and hard of hearing is called DeafSpace.

Along with a team of professors and students at Gallaudet University, Bauman is developing DeafSpace principles. These five principles help architects and designers understand how to create DeafSpace.

The first principle is space and proximity. The Deaf need space in which they can communicate using sign language. Following this principle, a room should have round tables instead of rectangular ones, so everyone can watch each other sign.

The second principle is sensory reach. An example of this is placing mirrors in specific places in a hallway. Since deaf people can't hear footsteps, the mirrors let them see when someone is behind them.

Wide hallways are an example of mobility and proximity; they allow two people to walk side-by-side while signing. 

Deaf people often get eyestrain because they rely on their eyes to know what's going on around them. Muted blue walls and soft lights are easier on their eyes. This is an example of the light and color principle.

Finally, acoustics deals with noise in a room. Some Deaf people wear hearing aids, which make sounds louder. Appliances such as air conditioners can be very loud for people with hearing aids. In DeafSpace, air conditioners are placed in areas where they are less disturbing.

DeafSpace is not just helpful for the Deaf. Open spaces, soft lighting, and less noise is good for everyone.

Today, people share many things. They share music and photos online. They share rides. Some people even share homes.

Co-living spaces are homes where groups of strangers live together. Each home has private areas and common areas. Most co-living spaces are for 20- and 30-year-olds.

WeLive is a co-living space in New York City. It used to be an office building, but now it's an apartment building. Residents have their own bedrooms, bathrooms, and small kitchens. They share a yoga room, movie room, large kitchen, and more.

Common is also in New York City. Residents of Common live in a townhouse. They have their own bedrooms, but two people share a bathroom. Everyone shares a living room and kitchen.

Some co-living spaces have many amenities. The Collective Old Oak in London has a library, spa, tea room, and "disco launderette." That's a laundry room with a dance floor! 

But the best part about co-living spaces is making connections with other people. "We're all about community," says Brad Hargreaves, Common's founder. "We're all about getting to know your neighbors."

Lifestyle
Today, thanks to the Internet, there's a lot of sharing going on. People share advice and opinions. They share music, photos, and videos. They share rides. Some even share their living spaces.

Co-living spaces are apartments or houses where groups of people live together. Each home has a mix of private and communal living areas. Co-living spaces are opening up in big cities across the US and around the world.

One such space, WeLive, took a New York City office building and built apartments for residents. Residents have their own bedrooms, bathrooms, and small kitchens; the spaces they share include a yoga room, movie room, and large kitchen.

In the co-living space Common, residents live in brownstones. Each person has his or her own bedroom, but shares a bathroom with another person. And everyone shares a living room and kitchen.

Co-living spaces are designed mostly for 20- and 30-year-olds. They have many social activities, from book clubs to dinners to musical events. They also have many amenities. The Collective Old Oak in London has a library, tearoom, and "disco launderette" -  a laundry room with a dance floor. The Embassy, a mansion in San Francisco, California, has its own bowling alley.

Co-living spaces help make life easy for residents. They come with furniture, towels, sheets, and blankets. They also offer shorter leases than regular apartment rentals, which often require a 12-month lease. Many co-living spaces allow residents to stay for six months or less.

What brings most people to co-living spaces, however, is the community. Residents have a built-in social group. "We're all about community," says Brad Hargreaves, founder of Common. "We're all about getting to know your neighbors."

Today, thanks to the Internet, there's a lot of sharing going on. People share advice and opinions. They share music, photos, and videos. They share rides and workspaces. And now, some are sharing living spaces - full time.

Co-living spaces, designed mostly for 20- and 30-year-olds, are apartments or houses where groups of people live together. They contain a mix of private and communal living areas. There are co-living spaces in big cities across the US and around the world.

One company, WeLive, turned offices in a New York City office building into 200 residential apartments. Residents have their own bedrooms, bathrooms, and small kitchens, but share common spaces, including a yoga room, movie room, and large kitchen, fit for a chef.

Another co-living company, called Common, renovated brownstones in New York City. Residents, or "members", have their own bedrooms, but share a bathroom with another person. Everyone shares a living room and kitchen. Residents organize group activities, such as book clubs and group dinners.

The shared spaces in The Collective Old Oak, in London, include a library, spa, Japanese tearoom, and a "disco launderette," a laundry room with disco balls and a dance floor! And the Embassy, a converted mansion in San Francisco, California, has a bowling alley.

In many co-living spaces, residents pay as much money, and often more, than they would if they rented a studio or one-bedroom apartment on their own. But in co-living properties, residents get "more bang for their buck." The properties are usually renovated, beautifully designed and furnished, and include a range of amenities. They also have fewer restrictions than standard apartment rentals; they don't require large security deposits, and they offer shorter leases than the standard 12-month lease.

For many residents, however, the biggest perk of co-living is that with all the people living in the same space, residents have a built-in community. Living in the city can be lonely, especially for those coming straight from a college dorm. And for co-living residents who are innovators and entrepreneurs, the community setting allows them to share knowledge and skills, and even form partnerships. "We're all about community," says Brad Hargreaves, founder of Common. "We're all about getting to know your neighbors."




What's Up (and Down) in Dining?
Lifestyle
Are you searching high and low for an unforgettable dining experience? Well, you're looking in the right places!

"Dinner in the Sky" is a Belgium-based company that hosts dinner events in skies around the world. Twenty-two diners sit around a table suspended in the air, eating a 3-to-6-course meal. A chef prepares the food and a wait staff serves it - all at a height of 50 meters. How do they get up there? The "restaurant" sits on a platform, which is lifted by a crane.

Dinner in the Sky started in 2007, as a one-time event for a group of restaurant owners. Word spread, and people started inquiring about hosting their own sky dinners. The creators decided to franchise the concept. Since then, there have been Dinner in the Sky events in more than 45 countries.

Dinner in the Sky venues are not permanent restaurants, but temporary installations. Plans for permanent Dinner in the Sky restaurants are in progress, though, including one in Las Vegas, Nevada (US).

Diners with a fear of heights may choose to eat lower down - much lower - at five meters below sea level. The "Ithaa Undersea Restaurant" is under the Indian Ocean, in the Maldives.

Being in Ithaa is like being in an aquarium. The restaurant's curved walls and ceiling are transparent, giving diners a panoramic view of the clear blue ocean. Looking through the window surrounding them, diners see thousands of colorful fish and coral. Turtles, stingrays, and even sharks swim by.

To get to Ithaa, diners walk across a wooden jetty, into a thatched hut. They walk down a winding staircase to the small aquarium-style restaurant. The restaurant has space for just 14 diners.

Ithaa was actually built in Singapore and transported to the Maldives by ship. The 175-tonne structure was then lowered into the ocean. The restaurant opened in 2005.

Maintaining Ithaa is difficult. The window gets dirty very quickly; scuba divers have to clean it before each meal. Another issue is the salt water, which corrodes the structure's steel frame, giving Ithaa a short "lifespan" of just 20 years.

Dinner in the Sky and the Ithaa Undersea Restaurant are both very expensive, but they definately take dining to the next level.

The first Dinner in the Sky event took place in 2007. It was a one-time event created for a group of restaurant owners. But it was so successful, that the Dinner in the Sky creators decided to turn their concept into a franchise. Now there are Dinner in the Sky events in more than 45 countries.
Look down, and you'll find the "Ithaa Undersea Restaurant." At Ithaa, diners eat under the sea, watching fish and other sea life swim by. Ithaa's curved transparent walls and ceiling offer diners an incredible panoramic view of the clear blue ocean. At five meters below sea level, diners see thousands of colorful fish and coral. Lucky diners might see turtles, stingrays, or sharks.

There is one problem with Ithaa. The restaurant will not last long. Salt from the ocean is destroying the restaurant's frame. So diners need to go to Ithaa soon!

Some people like camping. They like to be out in nature, away from the rest of the world. They bring food, water, and sleeping bags to a campsite. They sleep in tents. They make campfires for cooking and staying warm. It is hard work.
Other people also like to be in nature, but they want to be comfortable. They want to sleep in real beds and don't want to work hard. They go "glamping." Glamping has comforts that regular camping doesn't have. The word "glamping" is a combination of "camping" and "glamorous."
There are different kinds of glamping sites. In the Scottish Highlands, glamping visitors can sleep in a deluxe cabin with a bed, shower, and kitchen. Glamping treehouses in the Amazon Rainforest have beds, private bathrooms, and electric coffeemakers. They even have a chef!
You can go glamping all over the world - from Asia to New Zealand. Will you go glamping on your next vacation?

Do you enjoy camping? What about "glamping"? Glamping is a combination of the words "'glamorous"' and "camping." Over the last decade, this new kind of camping has become a trend. So...what is glamping?
Glamping has some aspects of traditional camping, but is more luxurious. Both glamping and camping allow people to be out in nature, away from civilization. However, campers bring all the things they need with them to campsites - food, water, shelter (a tent), and sleeping bags. "Glampers" don't need to. Many campers build campfires, using them for heat and for cooking food. Someone else makes the glampers' campfire.
Carrie Klair is the manager of Big Basin Redwoods Park campground in California. Klair says glamping is like camping; "you just don't have a backache when you're done." Why not? Campers work hard putting up tents, preparing food, and arranging the sleeping area. This is not true for glampers.
There are all different types of glamping places. The Ecopod Boutique Retreat in Scotland is in the picturesque Scottish Highlands. After a day outdoors, guests sleep in clean, eco-friendly cabins, called "pods." Inside are all the necessities, including a bed, kitchen, and shower. Guests can bathe in a private hot tub overlooking beautiful views. In Loreto, Peru, glampers can stay at Treehouse Lodge - in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. Guests can see birds and monkeys from their treehouse windows. There are beds, electric coffeemakers, and towels for the shower - and even an on-site chef!

Do you enjoy camping? Would you like it more if it were more comfortable? Over the last decade, "glamping" has become so popular, that the word - which is a combination of "glamorous" and "camping" - has been included in the online Oxford Dictionary. So...what is glamping?
Glamping has some aspects of traditional camping, such as being in nature, but feels like a luxury vacation. Carrie Klair, manager of Big Basin Redwoods Park campground, in California, says that with glamping, "you're still amongst the redwoods and the wildlife and the s'mores and the campfire; you just don't have a backache when you're done."
What many people like about camping is "roughing it" out in nature, away from civilization. Campers bring provisions with them to campsites - food, water, tents, and sleeping bags. Glampers don't need to. Many traditional campsites don't provide electricity or Internet access, allowing campers to take a break from electronic devices. Most glamping sites do provide Internet access. Camping requires hard work - putting up shelter, preparing food, arranging the sleeping area, and building campfires to cook food. Glampers don't have to do any of this - other people do it for them.
There are many different kinds of glamping accommodations. At the Ecopod Boutique Retreat, in Scotland, you can spend the day hiking in the Scottish Highlands. At night, you sleep in a clean, eco-friendly cabin called a "pod," which feels like a five-star hotel. Heated by a wood burning stove, the pod has everything you need, including a bed, kitchen, and shower. There is electricity and Internet access. You can bathe in a private hot tub overlooking beautiful views.
Have you ever dreamt of sleeping in a treehouse? In Loreto, Peru, you can stay at Treehouse Lodge in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest!

In many cities, it can be challenging to find fresh, organic produce. People who want access to healthy, organic food can participate in urban farming. Urban farming means growing plants and food in or around cities. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, there are 200 million urban farmers in the world. Two interesting urban farming programs were started in 2014 in Orlando, Florida, USA - "Growing Orlando" and "Fleet Farming."
Growing Orlando is a non-profit organization that grows produce on plots of land in downtown Orlando. The organization's volunteers farm these urban farms. Growing Orlando also teaches people how to grow their own produce at home - on rooftops or balconies. Additionally, the organization advises people who want to grow produce in large amounts, in order to sell it. At Growing Orlando's workshops, people can learn about farming and the farming business. Growing Orlando's farms have many different vegetables. These vegetables are sold at local farmers' markets. Brent Buffington started Growing Orlando. He believes that, like other cities, "Orlando is suffering from a lack of local food producers," and Growing Orlando can help.
Fleet Farming is also a non-profit organization. It's an urban farming community whose slogan is, "Grow food, not lawns." Many homeowners use gallons of water and chemicals to keep their lawns green. Homeowners in Orlando donate space in their yards to Fleet Farming. Then, volunteers turn the yards into gardens. They plant lettuce, kale, spinach, and other salad greens. Food grows in the space - instead of grass. "Most of the people who donate their lawns for our Fleet Farming project are novice gardeners who want to learn how to grow their own food," says co-founder Heather Grove. Twice a month, volunteers go around Orlando planting and harvesting food from the gardens - on their bikes! They go by bike "to encourage a healthy community [and encourage people] to come out on their bikes and join us," says Grove.
Growing Orlando, Fleet Farming, and organizations like them, provide locally-grown produce to residents. The volunteers spend a lot of time outdoors. They also strengthen community ties by meeting with people all over the city. Would you like to become an urban farmer?

As a little girl, Marie Kondo loved reading her mother's magazines. The magazines were about organizing. As an adult, Kondo created her own way of organizing. She calls it the KonMari Method. Today, Kondo is famous. She wrote four bestselling books about her method. She helps people all over the world organize their homes.
What is the KonMari Method? First, organize items by groups, such as clothes and books. Next, hold each item in your hand. If it makes you happy, keep it. If it doesn't, throw or give it away. Organize quickly. You should organize items all at once, not a few at a time.
Kondo thinks people keep too many objects. They are afraid to throw anything away. She teaches people to respect their possessions. For example, you can even respect your socks. How? Fold them a special way. Then, put them in your drawer.
Kondo believes her method helps people live happier lives. You "taught me to see what I really need and what I don't," said one of Kondo's clients.

Today, Kondo is famous for her own type of organizing. She calls it the KonMari Method She has written four books about her method. People all over the world have read Kondo's bestselling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.
The KonMari Method focuses on decluttering. Kondo believes that when you surround yourself with things that make you happy, you become happier in other parts of your life. Many people like to organize by room. But Kondo says it's better to sort by category, such as clothes, and then books.
Put all the items of the category you're working on into a pile. Hold an item from the pile in your hand, and ask yourself, "Does this spark joy?" In other words, "Does this object make me happy?" If the answer is "no," then give or throw it away. You should organize items all at once, not a few items at a time. So, give yourself deadlines and tidy up quickly.
Kondo believes you should also respect the items you have. Your socks work hard for you, Kondo says, and "the time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest." Treat them nicely by folding them and placing them neatly in your drawer.
The KonMari Method greatly appeals to people. More than one million people have viewed an online video of Kondo demonstrating how to fold socks!

In the Netherlands, the average life expectancy is 80 years. Senior citizens often go to traditional nursing homes which some call "islands of misery." The Dutch have developed two alternative models of long term care for the 21st century.
Over 100 senior citizens live in a special Dutch village called Hogewey. Like most small villages, it has a town square, a restaurant, a supermarket, and a post office. However, Hogewey a.k.a. "Dementia Village" was designed specifically for older people with severe dementia.
Residents of Hogewey's daily activities include shopping, eating in restaurants, and mailing letters. They don't realize the friendly people they interact with are actually caregivers who are specially trained to deal with dementia. Residents' lives seem independent and normal. However, their movements and activities are being monitored 24 hours a day by caregivers.
Hogewey residents can roam freely around the grounds, enjoying the gardens and the surrounding outdoor areas - but they can't leave the premises. Living spaces are also monitored. If residents approach the exit door, staff will politely steer them away. Residents may not always know exactly where they are, but they always feel right at home.

The Humanitas retirement home in Deventer, the Netherlands is also a pioneer in elder care. Students from local universities live in small apartments, rent-free, in exchange for volunteering with the senior residents. The students agree to be good, respectful neighbors and not be too noisy.

Students volunteer in various ways at Humanitas, including preparing meals and teaching computer classes. They help with daily tasks such as food shopping. The senior residents enjoy students' visits, too. They chat, play games, or just hang out. The staff hopes to create positive social interactions that are beneficial to all residents, both young and old.
Combating social isolation is important in elder care. Not surprisingly, innovations at facilities like Humanitas and Hogewey are beginning to catch on in other parts of the world. There are "Dementia Villages" underway in Germany and Switzerland. There are places similar to Humanitas in France and the U.S. Hopefully, the trend of building a better nursing home will continue to grow!

In the Netherlands, over 100 senior citizens live in a special place called Hogewey, a.k.a. "Dementia Village." In the Humanitas retirement home in Deventer, the Netherlands university students live with the older residents - without paying rent. Many Dutch senior citizens go to traditional nursing homes. Now, these two innovative facilities offer other options for seniors.
The residents of Hogewey all have severe dementia. Their lives seem independent and normal. However, when residents shop at the local store, eat in cafes, and mail letters at the post office, they are dealing with specially-trained caregivers. The residents feel as if they are continuing their lives as they would if they were living independently. In reality, they are being watched and cared for 24 hours a day.
Hogewey residents can walk freely through the outdoor areas, but they can't leave the village.  If a resident goes toward the exit door, staff gently steer them away. Residents' rooms are also monitored.

At Humanitas, students from local universities live in small apartments within the retirement home. They don't pay rent. Instead, they volunteer to help and spend time with the senior residents.  

Some ways the students help are by making meals for the older residents and teaching computer classes. Students also visit the seniors to talk and play games. They even shop for residents who can't. Humanitas wants to make sure that the older residents don't feel lonely or isolated. Positive social interaction with the students helps them feel connected.
The Dutch ideas on how to care for the older population have already caught on in countries such as France, the U.S., and Spain.

Lifestyle
In the Netherlands, many people live until they are 80 years old (sometimes longer). When older people get sick, they often go to nursing homes. In the Netherlands, they are building better nursing homes.
Hogewey, or "Dementia Village," is a different kind of nursing home. Only seniors with dementia live there. There is a restaurant, a supermarket, and a salon. People that "work" in these businesses are actually caregivers. The residents don't know that they aren't in a real village. Caregivers are always watching them, keeping them safe. 

The Humanitas retirement home is another Dutch nursing home. The residents at Humanitas were lonely. Being lonely sometimes hurts people's health. The caregivers at Humanitas had an idea. They invited university students to live in the nursing home. The students don't pay to live there. Instead, they spend time helping the older residents. This helps the seniors feel connected. It also helps them stay healthier longer.  

The Netherlands is not the only place where nursing homes are changing. France, the U.S., and Spain are also starting to build new kinds of nursing homes.

Do you ever sit at your desk using the computer for a long time? It makes your arms and neck hurt. Today, many people prefer to work standing up. How do they do it? They use special desks.
Scientists say that sitting too much makes you ill. People sit all day in the car, at home, and at work. Moving and exercising helps you stay healthy. There are treadmill and bicycle desks. Sit-stand desks adjust to go higher or lower according to your height. You sit for part of the day, and stand for the rest.
It is easy to build your own standing desk for work. First, put a small table on top of a bigger one. Then, put your computer on the small table. Make sure that you are comfortable. Finally, enjoy working at your new standing desk. You are on your way to better health!

Have you ever been sitting at your desk, using your computer for so long that your body began to hurt? Did you know that there are alternatives to traditional desks? Many people now spend at least part of their day standing instead.
Studies show that humans sit about 7.7 hours a day using computers, watching television, commuting, and eating. Researchers agree that a general lack of activity has a negative impact on health. They have coined the term "sitting disease" to describe people who lead an overly sedentary lifestyle. Inactivity puts you at risk for illnesses like heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and depression. A simple antidote to sitting is standing which increases blood flow, burns calories, and improves posture.
Most office workers spend the majority of their workday sitting down. The American Medical Association recommends companies provide workstation options, including standing desks. Employees who work from home can even fashion a standing desk by resting their computer on a high counter. Advocates of the standing desk report that they feel more productive and energetic. There are even treadmill and bicycle desks for those who want to exercise while they work.
However, sitting desks are not for everyone. Back, knee, or foot problems can develop from too much standing. Experts suggest sit-stand desks with adjustable height. Whatever choice you make, it is clear that sitting less each day has long-term health benefits. So, if you are sitting and reading this right now, consider standing up - for your health!

Most office workers spend the majority of their workday sitting down. The American Medical Association recommends companies provide workstation options, including standing desks. Employees who work from home can even fashion a standing desk by resting their computer on a high counter. While sitting desks are usually manufactured at a standard height, standing desks can be tailored to the user which is more convenient. Advocates of the standing desk report that they feel more productive and energetic. Some have even taken the standing desk to the next level - incorporating a treadmill or bicycle to exercise while they work. There is even a special platform called the Level which increases your heartbeat while you try to balance and stand at the same time.

However, transitioning from a sitting desk is not for everyone. It may not be practical or healthy to stand all day. Back, knee, or foot problems can develop from too much standing. Experts suggest sit-stand desks with adjustable height. Changing from a sitting to standing position promotes movement, and control over comfort while using a desk. Whatever option you choose, it is clear that sitting less each day has long-term health benefits. So, if you are sitting and reading this right now, consider standing up - for your health!




Getting Old Train Stations Back On Track!
Lifestyle
Have you ever seen a "ghost station"? It's not a haunted house; it's a train station that's no longer used.

Some cities have repurposed ghost stations, giving them new life. A famous example is the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, a beautiful art museum built in 1978 in an abandoned train station.

Today, cities continue to find ways to repurpose their ghost stations. London is one of them. It has an underground railway system called the London Underground or the "Tube." Since it travels underground, it helps ease congestion on London's streets. Built in 1863, many lines are no longer in use, so the city is turning to architects and urban planners for ideas. The most popular one so far is probably the London Underline. The idea behind the London Underline is to turn abandoned stations, and the tunnels connecting them, into underground paths. These paths will be used by bikers and pedestrians.

Having bikers travel below ground will help ease congestion even more. It'll also create a faster, safer, and more pleasant way for bikers (and pedestrians) to get around the city. The underground pathways will also have cafes, helping to create the feeling of a city under a city.

Paris' underground railway system has 11 unused stations. Some stations have been closed since World War II; others were never actually opened. French architects Manal Rachdi and Nicolas Laisne have some very unique ideas for the future of these stations. They want to turn each one into a different type of underground venue, such as a park, theater, art gallery, and even a swimming pool!

New York City recently repurposed a ghost station. But it wasn't one of its many underground railways, or "subway" stations. It was an abandoned freight train line. The city turned a raised section of the train line into a linear park, called the High Line. It's about 25 feet above street level and is filled with greenery and views of the Hudson River. Because it's raised above city traffic, there's no need to cross streets or wait at traffic lights.

Only time will tell if the suggested ideas will become realized. But it's clear that the masterminds behind them are on the right track!

Many cities have "ghost stations." They're not haunted houses; they're train stations that aren't used anymore.
Some of these cities want to repurpose their ghost stations and bring them back to life. New York City recently turned a set of train tracks into a park, called the High Line. The High Line is in Manhattan. It is 25 feet above ground, and from there you can see the Hudson River. The park is long and narrow, since it follows the train tracks. It's filled with plants and grass.
London also has plans to repurpose its ghost stations. It wants to find new uses for abandoned stations in London's Underground, also called the "Tube." The city is asking architects and urban planners for ideas. A very popular idea is a project called the London Underline. This project would turn the empty underground train stations, and the tunnels that connect them, into bike paths. This way, bikers could travel without worrying about traffic. Travel would be safer and quicker for bikers. And it would help ease London's congested streets. The London Underline would also have a path for walkers, as well as coffee shops. It would be a city under a city!
In Paris, there are about 11 underground ghost stations. Architects Manal Rachdi and Nicolas Laisne have some interesting thoughts on what to do with them. They want to give each station a new purpose. One station would be a theater, and another station a park. There would be an art gallery, and even a swimming pool!
Will these new ideas become a reality? We'll have to wait and see. But the masterminds behind them are certainly on the right track!

A "ghost station" is a train station that no one uses. Some cities want to turn their ghost stations into something new.
New York City turned a ghost station into a park. They call it the High Line. The park follows the train tracks, so it is long and narrow. It is also 25 feet above the ground.
In London, many people travel on the London Underground, or the "Tube." The Tube has ghost stations, too. The city is deciding what to do with them. It is asking urban planners for help. One idea is to create the London Underline. The London Underline will be an underground bike path. Bikers will ride through old Tube tunnels. They will not have to ride in traffic. The London Underline will have paths for walkers. It will have coffee shops.
You'll also find ghost stations in Paris. Some architects want to turn each underground station into something different. They have many ideas. One idea is to make an underground theater. Other ideas are to make an art gallery and a swimming pool!
Will these ideas work? We don't know. But they seem to be on the right track!




Gleaning
Lifestyle
Do you want to work on a farm and help people who are hungry? Try gleaning!
"Gleaning" is picking fruits and vegetables that farmers leave behind in the fields. This produce is for people who are hungry.
Farmers use machines to pick crops, but the machines miss some fruits and vegetables. Farmers also leave fruits and vegetables behind because they don't look good enough to sell to stores.
In Israel, Project Leket sends volunteers to farms across the country. The volunteers pick leftover fruits and vegetables. Leket sends this produce to people who are hungry.
The U.K., France, and Spain also have gleaning projects. In the U.S., about 25-33% of food on farms goes to waste. Gleaning groups help save this food.
In most gleaning projects, gleaners are volunteers, who pick produce for other people. But Oregon, in the U.S., has "low-income gleaning groups." In these groups, the gleaners are people who need food. They keep the produce that they pick.
People gleaned in ancient times. And now, gleaning is back in style!

Gleaning
Lifestyle
Do you want to work on a farm, feed the hungry, and keep food from being wasted? Then try gleaning.
"Gleaning" is gathering crops left in fields and orchards after a harvest, and giving them to people who don't have enough food. Gleaning is an ancient practice. But you'll find gleaning projects today, around the world.
Israel's Project Leket sends tens of thousands of people a year to fields and orchards across the country. Volunteers pick leftover fruits and vegetables. Leket sends this produce to groups that help people who live below the poverty line.
In the U.S., 25% -  33% of food that grows on farms goes to waste. Benjamin Rasmus of Rotary First Harvest (a group that fights hunger) explains why. Machines used for harvesting don't get all the crops. They leave some fruits and vegetables behind. Secondly, stores don't want to buy blemished produce. So farmers leave blemished fruits and vegetables in the fields and on the trees.
Another reason is that sometimes farmers have too much of a crop. They only pick what they can sell. The rest goes to waste.
The state of Oregon has low-income gleaning groups. The gleaners in these groups are people who live below the poverty line. They gather the produce for themselves and for others who need food but can't glean. Low-income gleaning groups help people from low-income households become self-sufficient.
Gleaning Network U.K. has gleaning projects in several U.K. cities, such as Manchester and London. They're also starting programs in France, Spain, and Belgium. It looks like the ancient practice of gleaning is making a comeback!

How would you like to work on a farm, feed the hungry, and keep food from going to waste? You can do it all by taking part in a gleaning project.
Gleaning is gathering crops left in fields and orchards after a harvest, and giving them to people who don't have enough food. It's an ancient practice, dating back to biblical times, yet you'll find gleaning projects today, in countries around the world.
Israel's Project Leket sends tens of thousands of people a year to fields and orchards across the country. After volunteers collect the leftover fruits and vegetables, the produce is delivered to organizations that feed people living below the poverty line.
The U.S. has gleaning programs in many different states. This is important, since 25 to 33 percent of food grown on the country's farms goes to waste. Benjamin Rasmus, program director of Rotary First Harvest - an organization in Seattle that fights hunger - explains why. He says machines used for harvesting don't reach all fruits and vegetables; they always leave some behind. Secondly, farmers don't pick fruits or vegetables with blemishes, because stores won't buy them.
Supply and demand is yet another reason crops are left over. A farmer who has an extra large crop of tomatoes will only harvest as many as he or she can sell. The rest will stay in the field and rot.
Todd Kaplan, a gleaner in the Boston area, says gleaning "moves an inordinate amount of food that would otherwise go to waste into the hands of people who really need it."
In the state of Oregon, you'll find something a bit different - low-income gleaning groups. The gleaners in these groups are people who live below the poverty line. They gather the produce for themselves and their "adoptees" (those who need food but are physically unable to glean). Low-income gleaning groups help people below the poverty line become self-sufficient.
Gleaning Network U.K. has gleaning projects in several U.K. cities, such as Manchester, Cambridge, and London. They're also expanding to France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The ancient practice of gleaning seems to be becoming a new trend!





When was the last time you saw penguins in person, or crocodiles up close? More than 700 million people visit zoos and aquariums each year. But the COVID-19 crisis has forced them to close their doors to the public temporarily. Now, animals in zoos and aquariums only see their fellow species and essential staff. Without the stream of new faces to entertain them, many animals get bored. So, caretakers started organizing "field trips" to let different species visit each other.
It started with the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago (USA). When it closed, the staff became worried about some of their animals, like the penguins. They knew that too much time alone, without visitors, wouldn't be healthy for them. So, the staff decided to take their penguins on a "field trip" to visit other aquarium residents!
With a staff member to guide them, a group of penguins waddled freely through the empty hallways. They stopped by the sea otters and watched them swim. They viewed the red-bellied piranhas, and the whales. The aquarium posted a video of this adventure on the Internet, and it went viral. The penguins looked like school children on a field trip!
Other zoos started taking their animals on field trips too. A donkey at Canada's Toronto Zoo visited the polar bears. Staff at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, USA, carried a large lizard over to the seal tank so the species could meet face-to-face.
According to animal experts, these types of experiences encourage animals to explore and problem-solve. They also provide animals with important mental and physical stimulation. The animals inside the exhibits benefit too. When alpacas visited gorillas at the Toronto Zoo, the gorillas began jumping up and down and banging on the glass with excitement.
And field trips aren't limited to zoo or aquarium animals. Eight-week-old puppies from the Atlanta Humane Society visited the Georgia Aquarium (Georgia, USA) for a day of fun. The puppies met sharks, manta rays, and other aquarium residents.
But not all species are suited for these adventures. Some animals feel uncomfortable or scared when they see new sights or other animals. Some animals are too big or too wild. But the animals that do go on field trips seem to enjoy them as much as humans do!

More than 700 million people visit the world's zoos and aquariums each year. But since the COVID-19 crisis, these places have been closed. The only humans animals see are a few workers. Without visitors, many animals feel bored. So, workers are taking animals on "field trips" to visit each other.
Animal field trips started at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago (Illinois, USA). The aquarium staff wanted to give some animals new, entertaining experiences. So, they took some penguins on a walk through the aquarium. The penguins waddled around and explored. They visited sea otters, piranhas, and whales. The staff posted a video of the adventure on social media. People loved it! Soon, other zoos started taking their animals on field trips.
At Canada's Toronto Zoo, some alpacas took a field trip to see the gorillas. The gorillas were so excited, they started jumping up and down. Animals in shelters are also taking field trips. Some eight-week-old puppies visited the Georgia Aquarium (Georgia, USA) for a day of fun. They saw sharks, manta ray fish, and other aquarium residents.
Animals can get tired of the same routine, like people. And spending too much time alone isn't good for them. That's why animal field trips are important. They help animals' minds and bodies stay healthy. Animal experts say that experiencing new objects, smells, and sounds is enriching for many animals.
But not all types of animals can go on these adventures. Larger animals are harder to control, making visits less safe. And some animals find new sights scary. But the animals that do go on field trips seem to enjoy them as much as humans do!

Many people visit zoos and aquariums. But not now. During the COVID-19 crisis, zoos and aquariums are closed. Now, the animals don't have visitors. This is bad for the animals. When animals don't have visitors, they get bored.
Workers at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago had an idea. They took the penguins on a field trip! The penguins waddled around the aquarium. They looked at different animals. They watched the sea otters and piranha fish. They watched the whales. The staff took a video of the penguins' trip. The staff put the video on the Internet. People loved it! Now, other aquariums and zoos are having field trips, too.
In the Toronto Zoo, alpacas visited gorillas. The gorillas got excited. They jumped up and down. Animals in shelters also take field trips. Puppies from a shelter visited the Georgia Aquarium. The puppies saw sharks and manta ray fish.
Scientists say field trips are good for animals. Field trips let animals see and do new things. This helps the animals stay happy and healthy.

Stand Up for the Improvaneers!
Arts & Entertainment
Have you ever seen an improvisational comedy show? In improvisational comedy ("improv"), people in the audience suggest ideas, and the actors spontaneously create a performance. Today, there is a new improv group that's a bit different. Rob Snow, who studied improv in the 1990s, recently started the Improvaneers - the world's first improv group made up entirely of people with Down syndrome!
In 2013, Snow and his wife Ellen created the nonprofit organization Stand Up for Downs in Ohio, USA after their son Henry was born with Down syndrome. The organization raised over $450,000 to help people with Down syndrome. Then, Snow got an idea for another way to enhance the lives of people with Down syndrome - forming an improv group. "My mind was racing with this idea of what improvisation can do for people with Down syndrome," remembers Snow.
From his personal experience, Snow knew that improv teaches many valuable skills, like problem-solving, quick thinking, and teamwork. Being in an improv group helps build self-confidence and improve communication skills as well. Snow believed that mastering these skills could expand social and workplace opportunities for people with Down syndrome. In 2018, twenty-five people with Down syndrome auditioned for the Improvaneers. Nine of them, ages 19 to 33, were chosen to be part of the group.
Improv is funny, and laughter is healthy. But for people with Down syndrome, improv is much more than that. Snow worked with psychologist Dr. Anna Esbensen at the Children's Hospital of Cincinnati to measure the progress of the Improvaneers members. They found that after one year, members showed improvement in skills including focus, listening, and eye contact.
In the future, Snow wants to create Improvaneers groups across the USA, opening up the stage to kids and teens. And it seems the experience has been quite positive for the first Improvaneers. "It just made my day when I saw [the audience] give a standing ovation," says 25-year-old Improvaneer member Audrey Costilow. Improvaneer Nick Doyle, who loves the experience of being on stage, adds, "I love when I get laughs from the audience. It makes me feel like a rock star!"

But Snow wanted to do more.
In the 1990s, Snow studied improvisational comedy (also called "improv"). At an improv show, people in the audience give ideas to the actors, and the actors create funny stories using the ideas. Snow learned that improv actors have to think fast, solve problems, and work well together with the other actors. He saw that improv helps people build self-confidence and learn about communication. Snow thought that improv could help people with Down syndrome have better jobs and social lives. So, he started Improvaneers - the world's first improv group for people with Down syndrome.
In 2018, twenty-five people with Down syndrome auditioned for Improvaneers. Nine of them, ages 19 to 33, became part of the group. How do they feel about the experience?

Psychologists at the Children's Hospital of Cincinnati studied Snow's work with the Improvaneers. They learned that Improvaneers had better focus, listening, and eye contact. But that's not enough for Snow. In the future, he hopes to create Improvaneers groups across the USA for kids and teenagers too.

The actors in the Improvaneers learn many things. They learn how to think fast. The actors also learn to listen to each other carefully. And they learn to work together. These skills are important for life too.
There are nine people in the Improvaneers. They are 19 to 33 years old. Snow also hopes to start groups for kids and teenagers soon.
The actors love being in the comedy group. Improvaneer Nick Doyle says it makes him feel like "a rock star."





Do you want to touch art? Then go to a "multisensory" art exhibit. At multisensory art exhibits you can touch, smell, hear, and even taste art. Multisensory exhibits are good for people who can't see. But they are also good for people who can see. Multisensory exhibits let everyone experience art in new ways.
One multisensory exhibit (at the Mosesian Center for the Arts in Massachusetts) has a three-dimensional painting. You can touch the figures in the painting. You can also make the figures dance.
Visitors at the "Multisensory Met" exhibit, in New York, smelled art. There was a photograph of a famous painting. Visitors scratched the photograph. Then, they could smell flowers and the sea.
The "Sensorium" was an exhibit in London. It had a dark painting of a man sitting on a park bench. Visitors ate chocolate with charcoal and tea flavors. This taste helped them understand the dark mood of the painting.
Multisensory exhibits are changing the way people think about art.

 

Please Touch the Art!
Arts & Entertainment
Most art museums have signs telling you not to touch the artwork. But a new kind of art exhibit wants you to touch the art. At "multisensory" art exhibits, visitors can not only see the art, but they can touch, smell, hear and sometimes taste it, too. Multisensory art exhibits give people with little or no eyesight alternative ways to experience art. But they also benefit sighted people. Using multiple senses to "view" art gives visitors a deeper understanding of an artist's work.
Integrated Abilities Dance is a three-dimensional painting at a multisensory exhibit at the Mosesian Center for the Arts, in Massachusetts, USA. It has figures of a man and woman dancing. The woman is sitting in a wheelchair. You can change the figures' positions to make them "dance".
A multisensory exhibit at The Met museum, in New York, included a photograph of a famous Monet painting. In the painting four people in a garden are looking out at the sea. Ezgi Ucar, the creator, wanted visitors to use their sense of smell, so she put scents of flowers and salt water on different parts of the photograph. When visitors scratched the different parts of the picture, they could smell different scents.
The "Sensorium" was a multisensory art exhibit at the Tate museum in London. It included a dark-colored painting of a man sitting on a park bench. Visitors were given charcoal-and-tea-flavored chocolate to help them "taste" the mood of the painting.
Multisensory exhibits are changing people's ideas about what "art" is. And they're sending a new message to visitors - Please, touch the art!

If you've been to art museums, you've probably seen signs telling you not to touch the artwork. But there's a new kind of art exhibit that's gaining in popularity - the "multisensory" art exhibit. This kind of exhibit encourages museum visitors to touch, smell, hear and even taste the art. By using several senses, visitors can connect more fully with artists' works. Multisensory art exhibits are great for people with impaired vision, as they give them alternate ways to experience art. But they are also great for sighted people, who learn to "view" art in a whole new way.
Integrated Abilities Dance is a multisensory piece of art at the Mosesian Center for the Arts, in Massachusetts, USA. The piece is a three-dimensional painting in which two sculptures, of a man and woman dancing, are attached to a canvas. The woman is in a wheelchair. Visitors make the figures dance by moving them around a black background that looks like a stage. Turning the wheelchair's wheel, for example, makes the male dancer rise up over the seated dancer.
Multimedia designer Ezgi Ucar created the exhibit "Multisensory Met" at The Met museum, in New York, USA. The exhibit included "scratch-and-sniff" paintings. To make one of these pieces, Ucar took a photograph of a famous Monet painting. The painting shows four people in a garden, looking out at a sea filled with boats. To help visitors interact with the painting, Ucar put powdered perfume - with floral, salt water, and spicy-cocoa scents - on different parts of the photograph. When visitors scratched the various parts of the picture, they smelled the different scents.
The Tate museum in London, England had a multisensory art exhibit called the "Sensorium". It included a painting by artist Francis Bacon, called Figure in a Landscape. It's a dark painting of a man sitting on a park bench under a narrow strip of blue sky. To help visitors experience the physical and emotional darkness of the painting, they were given charcoal-and-tea-flavored chocolate to eat. This helped visitors "taste" the mood of the painting.
Multisensory exhibits are changing people's ideas of what "art" is. They are also challenging artists to think of new ways to help people connect with their art.





Have you ever seen a classical ballet performance? To stay on their toes, ballet dancers wear special shoes called pointe shoes. The company Freed of London has been making pointe shoes for professional ballet dancers since 1929. Like other companies, Freed always made their shoes in the traditional color of light pink. Recently, Freed became the first company in the United Kingdom to introduce pointe shoes in darker shades, a reflection of ballet's growing diversity.
Pointe shoes are designed to make it look as if the dancer is barefoot. In the past, most professional ballet dancers had light skin. So, all ballet tights and shoes came in one color, light pink, to match their light skin tone. There were almost no professional ballet dancers of color. Over time, the ballet world became more diverse. The color of the tights and shoes no longer matched all the different skin tones of the dancers. To get the "barefoot" look, dancers of color had to make their pink shoes match their skin. They covered their shoes in makeup, using a technique called "pancaking". Pancaking takes a long time, and is expensive - especially since most professional dancers use more than 100 pairs of pointe shoes per season!
In 2019, Freed of London introduced pointe shoes and matching tights and socks in two new shades: "Ballet Bronze", and "Ballet Brown". Freed worked for over a year with Ballet Black, a ballet troupe for dancers of color, to design these new shades. The well-known and well-loved ballet shoe company states that they have always been committed to creating "shoes to meet the needs of each generation of dancer, and these new colors continue to reflect this."
Though Freed isn't the only company making products in a range of skin tones, it's an industry leader - producing 300,000 pairs of shoes per year. Cassa Pancho, the artistic director for Ballet Black, says, "To walk in and see shoes in your own skin color is a real change in the ballet world."

How do ballerinas stay up on their toes? They wear special shoes, called pointe shoes. The company Freed of London has been making pointe shoes since 1929. The company makes 300,000 pairs of ballet shoes per year. For many years, Freed of London only made shoes in light pink. But recently, Freed began making shoes in darker colors. With ballet's growing diversity, Freed wants to make sure that all dancers feel included.
Pointe shoes make it look like the dancer is dancing in bare feet. In the past, there were almost no professional ballet dancers of color. So dancers wore tights and shoes in one color, pink, to match their light skin color. Over time, more people of color entered the ballet world. But the color of the shoes and tights stayed the same.
Since ballet shoes and tights are pink, dancers with darker skin had to cover their shoes in makeup, so their shoes would match their skin color. This is called "pancaking". Pancaking takes a long time and is expensive. Most professional dancers use more than 100 pairs of pointe shoes per season!
That's why, in 2019, Freed of London stepped in and began selling shoes, tights and socks in two additional colors: "Ballet Bronze", and "Ballet Brown".
 
To create their new colors, Freed worked with Ballet Black, a ballet group for dancers of color. Freed isn't the only company making products for dancers of color, but it's the first British company to do so. Cassa Pancho, the artistic director for Ballet Black, says, "To walk in and see shoes in your own skin color is a real change in the ballet world."

So, dancers' pink shoes matched their light skin color. Dancers with darker skin had to color their shoes with makeup to match their skin color. This took a lot of time. It also cost a lot of money.
Today, there are many more ballet dancers of color. So, in 2019, Freed started selling shoes in two new colors. These colors are bronze and brown. They match darker skin.

Do you like dogs? There are interesting places for dog lovers to visit in the USA. There's the Museum of the Dog in New York City. There's also an exhibit called Dogs! A Science Tail. It's in Los Angeles.
The Museum of the Dog has thousands of books and hundreds of paintings about dogs. The museum uses technology to teach visitors about dogs. Do you know how to train a dog? You can train Molly, a virtual dog. Take your picture with a special computer. The computer will show you a picture of a dog that looks like you!
The exhibit in Los Angeles also uses technology. It helps you hear, smell and see like a dog. For example, there is a special fire hydrant. Smell it. That's what a dog smells when it's near a fire hydrant. There's also a 3D movie on a very big screen. It shows "super" dogs helping.
Who can see the exhibits? People only - no dogs!

Which queen of England had 75 dogs? Why do humans and dogs get along so well? How do dogs see the world? For answers to these questions, and many more, visit two unusual exhibits in the USA.
The Museum of the Dog, in New York City, uses technology in interesting ways. A special computer lets visitors practice "training" a virtual dog named Molly, using the same hand signals used for training real dogs. In another area, visitors use a computer's large touch screen to take their picture. Then, they can find out which dog breed they look like. There are also more traditional exhibits, such as paintings and sculptures from the museum's 1,700-piece art collection. And the museum's library has 4,000 books. There's a 30-million-year-old dog fossil, too!
The California Science Center in Los Angeles, also uses technology in their new exhibit, Dogs! A Science Tail. Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the center, says, "You can experience how a dog perceives the world." According to Rudolph, you can see, smell, hear, and run just like a dog. How? You look at a large screen with pictures projected onto it. The pictures look to you the way they would look to a dog. Push a button next to a fire hydrant, and smell exactly what a dog smells! There's also a documentary movie about dogs who help humans, called Superpower Dogs 3D. Watch dogs do amazing things, like saving people who are drowning, or rescuing people from buildings.
It's important to know one thing: tickets are for humans only. Both museums have a rule: "No dogs allowed!"

Which queen of England owned 75 dogs? Why do humans and dogs get along so well? How do dogs see the world? Curious canine enthusiasts can find answers to these questions - and many more - at two special exhibits in the USA.
First, there's a museum and interactive educational learning center called the Museum of the Dog, which recently opened in New York City. It's run by the American Kennel Club, an organization in charge of competitions for purebred dogs. Visitors to the museum can experience what it's like to train a dog with a digital Labrador named Molly. Using a special computer program, visitors practice hand signals and other training techniques. At the "Find Your Match" part of the museum, visitors use a computer's large touch screen to take their picture, then find out which dog breed they most look like. Visitors who prefer more traditional exhibits can enjoy special items from the museum's 1,700-piece art collection, featuring paintings, watercolors, and sculptures. They can also explore the museum's library of 4,000 books. The museum's fascinating collection even includes a 30-million-year-old dog fossil!
The California Science Center, in Los Angeles, has also integrated technology into their new hands-on exhibition called Dogs! A Science Tail. Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the center, says that at the exhibition, "You can experience how a dog perceives the world. You can run like a dog, you can see like a dog, you can hear like a dog, or smell like a dog." How? You put your head inside a large model of a dog's head. Then, you watch a screen with images that appear to you as they would to a dog. Push a button next to a fire hydrant, and you can smell what a dog smells! The exhibition also examines the 15,000-year history of the relationship between dogs and humans. And there's a documentary movie called Superpower Dogs 3D, which is shown on a movie screen more than 20 meters high. Visitors can watch amazing dogs from around the world helping humans by saving them from drowning, rescuing them from collapsed buildings, or tracking down criminals.
It's important to remember that tickets to these two interesting attractions are for humans only. Both places have a strict rule: "No dogs allowed!"





Have you ever visited a library that didn't have books to read? Step inside Brooklyn Art Library in New York, USA, and you'll find shelves filled with over one million pages of artistic images. The library houses a unique trove of global art called The Sketchbook Project.
The Sketchbook Project, currently the largest collection of sketchbooks in the world, has crowdsourced sketchbooks from people living in more than 130 countries. The project is open to professional artists and amateurs of all ages. The project's co-founder, Steven Peterman, says the goal was to create something "that was inclusive of everyone that wanted to be a part of it". That's why you can find sketchbooks from schoolchildren in Sudan on a shelf next to a sketchbook from a Swedish musician. 
Together with Shane Zucker, Peterman started The Sketchbook Project in 2006 as an informal way for anyone to create art and be part of a global activity. People ordered blank sketchbooks from The Sketchbook Project Web site, and returned the completed sketchbooks to Peterman and Zucker, who exhibited them all over the USA. The project was so successful that they opened the Brooklyn Art Library in 2010 to house the rapidly-growing collection. The library is known as "a free museum where you can touch the art" because people can hold and look through the sketchbooks.
How can you participate in The Sketchbook Project? You purchase a sketchbook, which is only about 13 by 18 centimeters in size, from the Web site for $30. For an additional $35, your sketchbook will be scanned into a digital library. A six-digit barcode on each sketchbook helps keep track of them in the Brooklyn Art Library's catalogue, and artists are notified each time their sketchbook is looked at or checked out.
So, what's inside the sketchbooks? Architect Sheilla Sumayang's sketchbook illustrates her childhood in the Philippines. Five-year-old Hayden Scannell decorated his pages with colorful pieces of tape. There are books of watercolor paintings, doodles, and pages with holes cut out - there are no rules.
Soon, the project will be heading to Europe for a tour called "Tiny Sketchbooks".  And after that? "We want to focus on the collection and find ways to become a resource for artists all over the world," says Peterman.

Libraries are usually full of books, but not the Brooklyn Art Library in New York, USA. It has over one million pages of art. It's a special collection of global art called The Sketchbook Project.
The Sketchbook Project is the largest collection of sketchbooks in the world, with participants from more than 130 countries. The project's co-founders wanted to include work by people of all ages, nationalities, and artistic ability. That's why you might find a sketchbook from a Swedish musician next to some sketchbooks by schoolchildren from Sudan in the library. 
Steven Peterman and Shane Zucker started The Sketchbook Project in 2006. They sold blank sketchbooks through a Web site. Then, the pair exhibited the completed sketchbooks all over the USA. The project was so successful that they opened the Brooklyn Art Library in 2010 as a place to keep the growing collection. At the library, visitors can actually touch the art, looking at the pages in the sketchbooks.
How can you be part of The Sketchbook Project? You purchase a sketchbook, which is only about 13 by 18 centimeters in size, from the Web site for $30. Inside the sketchbooks, people do anything they want. There are doodles, watercolor paintings, pages with holes cut out - and more. Architect Sheilla Sumayang filled her sketchbook with childhood memories. Five-year-old Hayden Scannell decorated his pages with colorful pieces of tape. Every sketchbook has a barcode, so artists can be notified each time their sketchbook is viewed.

Do you enjoy drawing? The Brooklyn Art Library has the largest collection of sketchbooks in the world. It's called The Sketchbook Project.
To be part of the project, visit the project's Web site. You don't have to be an artist. And it doesn't matter how old you are. Everyone is welcome! At the Web site, you buy a blank sketchbook with a barcode for $30. You can fill in your sketchbook with anything you want. Some people paint pictures. Others cut up the pages. One five-year-old used colorful tape. After you finish, you send your sketchbook back to the project. Because of the barcode, you get a message every time someone looks at your sketchbook!
People in more than 130 countries sent sketchbooks to the project - everywhere from Sweden to Sudan. And anyone can visit the library, sit down, and look at the sketchbooks. But it will take a very long time to see them all - there are more than 40,000!




Building a Better Team
Arts & Entertainment
Do you work on a team? When teams work well, companies make money and succeed. Sometimes, it's hard to work as part of a team. So, companies do team-building activities. These activities can help teams work better together - and they're fun, too!
The Dinner Detectives is an example of a team-building activity. During dinner, each team solves a "crime". This activity helps teams learn to work together. Then, they can use these skills to solve real problems at work.
The TeamBonding company has many activities to choose from. One example is ice sculpting. In this activity, teams make different shapes from ice. Team members learn to cooperate while they work. They also learn to be more creative.
The Go Game, is a scavenger hunt. During the game, teams try to complete interesting tasks. For example, teams make a funny video together. At the end, winners get prizes.

Teamwork is important for a company's success. Many companies provide team-building activities to help teams work together better. These activities can be a fun way to develop important skills.
The Dinner Detectives is one example of a fun team-building activity. It includes a team dinner where teams have to solve a mystery! First, each person chooses an alias. Then, they are told a "crime" has been discovered. Teams improve their problem-solving skills while trying to find out who did the crime. Team members leave the activity feeling more confident, and ready to participate more back at work.
TeamBonding is a company which offers a variety of team-building programs. Some of the activities are improvisational comedy, painting a team mural, and ice sculpting. In the ice sculpting activity, teams use a chisel, gloves, and their imagination. Team members develop cooperation skills and increase creativity while making their ice sculpture.
The Go Game is a scavenger hunt. This activity is good for people who don't work together in an office, so they don't see each other often. During the game, people get to know each other in person while working on interesting missions. For example, using a special smartphone, teams make a video of themselves recreating scenes from famous movies. But they use only their fingers instead of actors! Playing the game builds trust among team members. At the end of the scavenger hunt, participants gather to review the videos. Then everyone votes, and winners get prizes at an awards ceremony.
These are just a few of the many options for team-building activities. Which activity would you choose?

Steve Jobs, American entrepreneur and CEO of Apple Inc., believed that, "Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people." Many companies agree. Teamwork can be the key to a company's success. It helps companies run more efficiently and frequently leads to increased profits. Companies that value teamwork often provide team-building activities for their employees. These activities may develop important skills, be purely for entertainment, or achieve both at the same time.
 The Dinner Detectives is an activity which combines skill development and entertainment. During a nice dinner, participants (each using an alias) also have to solve a mystery. The action begins when a "crime" is discovered. Professional actors, hidden throughout the dining room, help teams improve their problem-solving skills while investigating the crime. Participants have said this activity helps them "come out of their shell". They return to work feeling more confident about interacting with their colleagues.
TeamBonding is a company which offers a wide range of programs including improvisational comedy, painting a team mural, and ice sculpting. TeamBonding's unique ice sculpting activity involves lots of creativity, teamwork, and cooperation. Participants put on gloves and transform a block of ice using only chisels and their imaginations. Some teams have managed to sculpt their company logos into the block of ice! This event is quite successful. One participant said, "This activity was great because it didn't alienate anyone or create awkward situations where people are put on the spot, or where un-athletic people are uncomfortable, etc, as some team activities tend to do."
The Go Game, a 21st century scavenger hunt, is a fun way for people working in a "virtual office" to get to know each other and build trust in a face-to-face setting. Participants explore different locations as they complete creative challenges. For example, using a special smartphone, they film themselves recreating scenes from famous movies - using their fingers as the actors! The Go Game ends with a "Multi-Media Finale" during which all participants gather to review the videos submitted by each team. Then, they vote on the best videos, and the experience concludes with an awards ceremony.
These are just a few of the many options for team-building activities. Which team-building activity would you choose?




Foods with Style!
Arts & Entertainment
If the foods you make never look quite as appetizing as those you see in cookbooks or magazines, don't be discouraged. What you see in those photos is the work of professional food stylists.
A food stylist prepares food for a photoshoot. The photos are featured in food magazines, ads, and cookbooks, as well as on Web sites and food packages. Food stylists make each dish look so enticing that people can "smell" and "taste" it with their eyes.
Food stylists do many jobs. First, they shop for the ingredients needed for each dish, picking out what looks best. On the set of the photoshoot, they prepare the food for cooking. And in many cases, they do the cooking, too. Finally, they do the work they're most known for - food presentation.
To make each dish look its best, food stylists use a range of techniques. They'll spray water on salads and herbs to give them a fresh, crisp look. They'll stick skewers into multi-layered sandwiches to hold them together. Sometimes they'll use "tricks of the trade," such as touching up strawberries with lipstick. Or, for roasted chicken, they'll photograph it when it's brown, plump, and juicy on the outside but still raw on the inside. The longer the chicken stays in the oven, the drier it gets.
 
Sometimes food stylists use fake food, such as white glue instead of milk in a bowl of cereal, so the cereal doesn't get soggy, and look unattractive. Most food stylists today, however, strive for authenticity - using the actual foods, and making them look as natural as possible, crumbs and all.
The food stylist works with a prop stylist and a photographer. The prop stylist helps create a scene by adding objects such as napkins and drinking glasses. The photographer and food stylist discuss lighting and angles.
Photoshoots take many hours. During this time, foods may lose their freshness. Melted cheese in a cheeseburger, for example, will congeal. The food stylist might blow-dry it to melt it again or make fresh cheeseburgers - anything to get that "beauty shot".
"I think that food is beautiful on its own," says food stylist Laura Goble. "You just need the ability to see it, and then help the photographer catch it."

In addition to being an exciting experience, Comic-Con serves as a platform for aspiring comic creators, science fiction and fantasy writers, artists, and costume designers. Comic-Con can help launch new careers, and in the process, inspire even more fans!





If you are walking in the woods near Copenhagen, Denmark and come across a wooden giant hiding among the trees, don't be afraid! It just might be Little Tilde. Little Tilde is one of six incredible figures that make up a group of sculptures called The Six Forgotten Giants. The only way to find these giants is by using a treasure map, or following clues engraved on stones, which direct you from one giant to the next.
The six giants, and the treasure hunt to find them, are the creation of Danish artist Thomas Dambo. Dambo wanted to bring art out of the museum and encourage people to explore the nature that surrounds Copenhagen. "I have placed all of the sculptures in places where you normally wouldn't go, but still in places which you can reach with public transportation or preferably on your bicycle," explains Dambo.
The giants came to life thanks to recycled wood. The sculptures were constructed using over 600 old wood pallets and any other used wood Dambo could find. He had many volunteers to help him. From artists to school children to senior citizens, volunteers of all ages and backgrounds worked on the giants.
Dambo wanted to make the giants seem real, so he gave each one a name and designed them to interact with their environment and visitors. Oscar Under The Bridge seems to hold up the bridge above him, Sleeping Louis naps on the hillside, and Thomas On The Mountain relaxes in the woods. The giants also provide something special for their visitors. People can crawl into Sleeping Louis' large, open mouth and play inside him. Hill Top Trine has outstretched hands, which visitors can climb up into for a view of the countryside. Little Tilde has 28 birdhouses inside her belly "for the birds and maybe a squirrel to seek shelter." And walking along Teddy Friendly's arm will help visitors cross a stream.
Dambo sums up the goals of his project best: "I hope it will give people a good experience, remind them that it's fun to go exploring and hopefully make them remember that their trash might have value for someone else before they send it with the garbage truck to be burned or buried on a beautiful piece of land."

Outside Copenhagen, Denmark, six wooden giants hide in the forest. Don't worry, these are friendly giants. They make up a group of sculptures called The Six Forgotten Giants. You can only find them by following a treasure map or clues. The clues help you get from one giant to the next.

The giants, and the treasure hunt to find them, were created by Thomas Dambo, a Danish artist. He put the sculptures in places where people don't usually go, but which are accessible by public transportation or bike. Dambo wanted to bring art out of the museum and encourage people to explore nature.

Dambo built the sculptures using over 600 old wood pallets and any other wood he could find. He believes it's important to recycle old materials, so he reuses them in his art.

Dambo wanted to make the giants seem real. He gave each one a name and designed them to fit in with the environment. Oscar Under The Bridge sits under a bridge. Sleeping Louis sleeps on a hill. And Thomas On The Mountain relaxes in the woods. The giants also provide something special for their visitors. People can crawl into Sleeping Louis' large mouth and play inside him or climb up into the hands of Hill Top Trine. There are 28 birdhouses inside Little Tilde. The birdhouses are "for the birds and maybe a squirrel to seek shelter," explains Dambo. And Teddy Friendly's arm can help visitors cross a stream.

Dambo hopes his six giants will give people a good experience and remind them that it's fun to go exploring. So, are you ready to go find them?

In China, there's a valley with a large art project inside. The valley is the Yelang Valley. The art project is a group of faces made out of rocks and stones.
Peilun Song is the artist doing the art project. Song started making stone faces in 1996. He is still making them today. Song got the idea to make the faces from ancient masks. They were wooden masks, called Nuo masks. Ancient people in the Yelang Valley wore Nuo masks during religious ceremonies. They believed the masks kept them safe and healthy. Song likes ancient Chinese culture. He wants his art to look like the art of ancient cultures.
Builders who live near Yelang Valley help Song. Song tells the builders what faces to make. Then the builders cut the stone and build the faces.
Today, many people come to visit Yelang Valley. Many artists and musicians live there. In the future, Song hopes people will continue to make art in Yelang Valley.

Valley of Art
Arts & Entertainment
In the Guizhou province of China, among the mountains, waterfalls, and trees there is a forest of stone. Welcome to Yelang Valley!
Peilun Song is a Chinese artist. In 1996, he bought almost 50 acres (200,000 square meters) of land in Yelang Valley and began building there. He chose Yelang Valley because he's very interested in ancient Chinese culture, and experts believe that many ancient cultures lived in Yelang Valley. Song wants his artwork to represent the culture, folk traditions, customs, and architecture of the people who lived there.
The ancient Yelang Valley inhabitants wore special wooden masks, called Nuo masks, during religious ceremonies. The masks looked like human faces. People believed that these masks could keep them healthy and happy. The Nuo masks inspired Song to design huge stone faces in the valley. Yelang Valley is the perfect place for Song's project, because there's a lot of stone available in the area.
Stonemasons from the local villages help with Song's art. After Song designs the structures, stonemasons break up the stones and do the actual building. The stonemasons believe in Song's project so much that even though Song no longer has enough money to pay them, they continue to work for free.
 
Many people come to Yelang Valley to see Song's artwork. There's also a community of painters and musicians living in the valley. But Song's masterpiece is far from being complete. In fact, Song wants Yelang Valley to be "a piece of artwork for our society, our children, nature, and history to finish."

In the Guizhou province of China, among the mountains, waterfalls, and trees, a forest of stone faces overlooks a river. Welcome to Yelang Valley!
Artist Peilun Song has turned the valley into a piece of artwork by creating giant faces built from rocks and stones. Song wanted his artwork to represent the culture, folk traditions, and customs of the various ancient cultures that lived in Yelang Valley. So, in 1996, he purchased nearly 50 acres (200,000 square meters) of land in the valley, and began creating his tribute to its ancient inhabitants. Although Song began work on his masterpiece more than twenty years ago, his work still continues today. And fortunately, Yelang Valley is not lacking rocks and stones!
Song, known as "The Father of Yelang Valley", was inspired by the ancient tradition of wearing wooden Nuo masks. Nuo masks, carved to look like human faces, were worn during religious ceremonies. People believed these masks could keep them healthy and happy. Today, huge Nuo masks tower over the valley.
Song was also inspired by the Crazy Horse memorial in South Dakota, USA, a memorial being carved out of a mountain. Both the Crazy Horse and Yelang Valley projects were started as a way to preserve the past, and both projects have been going on for many years.
When Song first came to the valley, he met stonemasons from the local villages. Song hired them to help turn his vision into reality. Song designs the structures, and the stonemasons break up the stones, and do the actual building. "My thoughts need to be carried out by their hands," says Song. The stonemasons believe in the project so much that even though Song has run out of money to pay them, they continue to work for free.
Today, Yelang Valley attracts many visitors. But it has also attracted a community of painters and musicians, who live there. As for the valley's future, Songs says his work isn't finished yet, and he hopes it will remain a "piece of artwork for our society, our children, nature, and history to finish."




Unusual Bookstores

When you think of a bookstore, you probably picture a building filled with books on an array of topics. But there are several bookstores around the world that will change this picture in your mind.
Walk into the University Press of France (Les Puf for short), in Paris, and you're in for a surprise. Instead of seeing rows and rows of books, you'll see tablets and a large printer. The tablets contain catalogs of books. Customers look through the catalogs and decide which books they want to buy. Then, while they wait, the machine prints out their books. The machine is called the Espresso Book Machine, because most books can be printed in the amount of time it takes to drink a cup of coffee! Although Les Puf is less than 80 square meters (861 square feet) in size, millions of books are available.
Are you interested in the world of theater? The Samuel French Theatre Bookshop in London, England, only carries books related to theater. There, you'll find a wide range of plays and theater books. Samuel French, one of the biggest drama publishers in England, has been publishing, selling, and leasing plays since 1830. If you're looking for a play, you can browse the bookstore's collection of more than three thousand scripts. For fans of musicals, the bookstore has musical scores and librettos. Aspiring actors can find many books about acting. There are also biographies of directors, actors, and playwrights - including England's own Shakespeare.
Bart's Books is an outdoor bookstore. It was founded in 1964, when Richard Bartinsdale moved into a house in Ojai, California, USA. Bartinsdale put bookshelves filled with books outside his home. Neighbors would take books and leave payment in empty cans on the bookshelves. Today, Bart's Books has hundreds of thousands of books outside and inside. People can sit and read books in special outdoor areas. The books you find outside stay outside year-round, day and night. If you want to buy a book after hours, you just choose one from a shelf, and drop money through a slot in the door.

When you think of a bookstore, you probably picture a building filled with books on all different topics. But there are bookstores around the world that will change this picture in your mind.
When you walk into the University Press of France (also called "Les Puf") in Paris, you won't see rows of books along the walls. Instead, you'll see tablets and a big machine. The tablets contain catalogs of books. You look through the catalogs and choose the books you want. Then, while you wait, the machine prints out your books!
The Samuel French Theatre Bookshop in London, England, is also unusual. It's different from other bookstores because it only carries books related to theater. The bookstore's collection includes more than three thousand play scripts. There are also books on acting, and biographies of directors, actors, and playwrights. If you like musical theater, you can browse the shop's musical scores and librettos.

Ballet started in Europe over 600 years ago. Ballet dancers perform to classical music. Hip-hop is a style of dance and music that started in the late 1900s America. Put them together, and you have - Hiplet!
Homer Hanz Bryant invented Hiplet ("HIP-lay") in 2005. Bryant is a dancer and dance teacher. He started teaching Hiplet at his dance school, the Chicago Multi-Cultural Dance Center in Illinois, USA. One reason he created Hiplet was to get dancers who enjoy hip-hop interested in ballet.
Most days, Bryant's students learn ballet. They wear special "pointe" shoes, so they can dance on their tiptoes. When students do Hiplet, they also wear pointe shoes. But they dance hip-hop moves to hip-hop music.
Some people are afraid that Hiplet can hurt dancers' feet and ankles. But Bryant isn't worried. He says practicing ballet makes dancers' feet and legs strong.
Hiplet dancers are having fun! Jackson, a 13-year-old dancer says, "I love how freestyle and fun it is."

Ballet is a dance form that started in Europe over 600 years ago. Ballet dancers perform to classical music. Hip-hop is a type of dance and music developed in twentieth-century America. Put them together, and you have - Hiplet!
The journey to Hiplet (pronounced "HIP-lay") began in the 1990's. Homer Hanz Bryant, a professional dancer and dance instructor, started the Chicago Multi-Cultural Dance Center (CMDC) in Illinois, USA, in 1992. He encouraged young students to ballet dance to rap music. Then, in 2005, Bryant started teaching Hiplet classes. Bryant created Hiplet because he believes that it's important to connect ballet's "old-fashioned" technique to modern times.
Today, most CMDC classes are still in classical ballet. Students learn graceful classical ballet techniques, including how to dance "en pointe". Special pointe shoes support the dancers' feet. This allows dancers to put all their body weight on their tiptoes. Hiplet dancers wear pointe shoes like classical ballet dancers. But Hiplet's music and dance moves come from hip-hop.
Some people are concerned that Hiplet's dance moves could injure dancers' feet and ankles. But according to Bryant, CMDC dancers are required to strengthen their legs and feet "en pointe" before they are allowed to try Hiplet. Students must audition to be accepted to Hiplet classes, and they do Hiplet for just one hour, once a week. The rest of the time they do classical ballet.
Bryant's Hiplet dancers are enjoying the new dance style. Jackson, a 13-year-old dancer says, "I love Hiplet because I love the movements that we do, and I love how freestyle and fun it is."

Ballet is a type of dance that originated in Europe in the fifteenth century. Traditional ballet is performed to classical music. Hip-hop is a dance and musical performance style that developed in twentieth-century America. Put them together, and you get Hiplet!
Hiplet (pronounced "HIP-lay") combines ballet and hip-hop, creating a new unique dance style. The journey to Hiplet began when Homer Hanz Bryant started encouraging young classical ballet students at his Chicago Multi-Cultural Dance Center (CMDC) to dance to rap music. Bryant, a professional dancer and dance instructor, started CMDC in Illinois, USA, in 1992. He wanted to give all types of people, including those who can't afford classes, a chance to study classical ballet.
Although CMDC teaches other kinds of dance, such as modern dance and tap dancing, most of the classes are classical ballet. Classical ballet students must be very disciplined. Discussing his students, Bryant says, "No matter where they go in life, they take that discipline with them." CMDC students learn graceful classical ballet techniques, including how to dance "en pointe". When dancing en pointe, dancers wear special shoes and put all their body weight on the tips of their toes.
Although Hiplet dancers wear pointe shoes, the music and dance moves are from hip-hop. Bryant created Hiplet because he wanted to connect ballet's "old-fashioned" technique to the present age. "I think in order to stay relevant with young people, you have to do what they're doing now," says Bryant. Bryant started teaching Hiplet classes in 2005. In 2009, he had the dance style trademarked. Students who want to take Bryant's Hiplet classes must audition to be accepted.
Some people are concerned that Hiplet's dance moves could injure dancers' feet and ankles. But according to Bryant, CMDC dancers are required to strengthen their legs and feet en pointe before they are allowed to try Hiplet. In fact, Bryant's students only do Hiplet for one hour once a week. The rest of the time they do classical ballet.

The Gu�delon Castle
Arts & Entertainment
Have you ever wondered how buildings were constructed in medieval times? You can find the answer in France, at Gu�delon Castle. Although there are castles throughout France, Gu�delon is different from all of them. It wasn't built in ancient times like other French castles. Construction on Gu�delon Castle only began in 1997, and it's still being built today (expected completion is 2020).
Gu�delon Castle is a working "medieval" construction site. Michel Guyot, who preserves old castles, had the idea to build a new "old" castle. Guyot, along with a team of architects and art historians, closely studied existing 13th-century castles to get the details just right. They chose to build the castle in the Gu�delon Forest (that's how the castle got its name). This site was chosen because it contains the resources needed for building the castle. It has a quarry where builders can get stone, a pond for water, and trees for wood.
Every part of the structure is built as it would have been built hundreds of years ago. In addition to chopping down trees for wood, workers use hemp ropes made on site. Instead of using a tape measure, workers use a special hemp rope with 13 knots to measure things, just like builders in the 13th century. Also, clay from the site is used to make thousands of tiles for floors and roofs.
Hemp and clay are examples of sustainable building materials. Visitors to Gu�delon learn practical lessons on sustainable building and saving energy. Florian Renucci, the castle's building supervisor says, "Using materials like earth and sand allows us to construct houses that, in terms of energy, cost a thousand times less than any building using steel."
Usually, people who aren't involved in a building project aren't allowed near a construction site. But Gu�delon is open to the public. Around 300,000 people visit each year to learn about medieval life. Employees explain their work process to Gu�delon visitors. Many workers even wear period clothing. Short-term volunteers also come to Gu�delon - helping workers build walls and cut stone. So, travel back to the Middle Ages by visiting Gu�delon Castle!

In the Middle Ages, people built castles. How did they do this? Visit Gu�delon Castle, in France, to find out.
Gu�delon Castle looks like it's from the 13th century. But people only started building it in 1997. And they are still building it today.
Michel Guyot had the idea to build the castle. He decided to build it inside the Gu�delon Forest. Guyot chose the forest because it has wood, water, and stone. These are the materials workers need to build the castle. Because the castle is in the Gu�delon Forest, Guyot named it Gu�delon Castle.
Usually, only workers can visit a construction site. But at the Gu�delon construction site, anyone can visit. Around 300,000 visitors come each year. They learn about life in the 13th century. Many workers even dress like it's still the 13th century! Visitors take a tour of the site, and workers explain their building methods. Visitors can also help build the castle.
So, visit Gu�delon Castle, and travel back to the Middle Ages!





Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. Sometimes the temperature is -89�C. Antarctica has lots of ice, wind, and snow. The weather is harsh for humans. Yet in the past, some explorers went there. They even crossed the continent. It was very hard, but they had help. Dogs pulled their sleds. People gave them food along the way.
In 2018, an American athlete named Colin O'Brady wanted to ski across the Antarctic. He wanted to go alone. He didn't want any help. A British explorer named Louis Rudd also wanted to ski across Antarctica. So, on November 3, 2018, O'Brady and Rudd had a race.
O'Brady pulled a sled full of food and supplies. The sled weighed about 180 kilograms. Each day, O'Brady wrote about his trip on social media. O'Brady skied 1,482 kilometers across the frozen continent in 53 days. He finished two days before Rudd. O'Brady says he wanted to cross Antarctica alone to show people that nothing is impossible
 

The Impossible First
Sport
Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth. With temperatures as low as -89�C, water freezes instantly. Antarctica has snow and strong winds, and is covered with a layer of ice more than a kilometer thick. Despite these harsh conditions, in 2018, American athlete Colin O'Brady became the first person to ski across the Antarctic alone and unassisted.
While the trek took 53 days, O'Brady's journey actually began back in 2008. While vacationing in Thailand, O'Brady had a terrible accident. His legs were badly burned, and doctors said he might never walk again. Thankfully, O'Brady recovered and became a professional endurance athlete. He skied to the North Pole and reached the top of Mount Everest.
Another of O'Brady's goals was to be the first to cross Antarctica without help. Just a few days before his trek, the 33-year-old met British explorer Louis Rudd. Rudd was also trying to cross Antarctica alone, so the men decided to see who could reach the other side first.
Other explorers had crossed the Antarctic alone before, but they had received help. Some were given supplies along the way. Others had dogs or giant kites to pull their sleds. But O'Brady pulled his own sled - packed with around 180 kilograms of supplies. This included his main food source - 280 nutrition bars. O'Brady posted news of his expedition on social media every day. In total, he skied 1,482 kilometers in 53 days - beating Rudd by two days.
O'Brady named his expedition "The Impossible First". He said, "I've been preparing my mind, my body, my spirit, for something they say is impossible, to show you that nothing is impossible."

Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth, with temperatures falling as low as -89�C. It's also the driest continent, since any water freezes instantly. Antarctica has strong winds, and is covered with a layer of ice more than a kilometer thick. These harsh conditions make traveling over the continent's surface extremely difficult. Yet, on December 26, 2018, 33-year-old American Colin O'Brady became the first person to ski across Antarctica alone and unassisted.
Although O'Brady had started his Antarctic trek 53 days earlier, his journey actually began back in 2008. While vacationing in Thailand, O'Brady had an accident that caused severe burns on over 25% of his body, mostly his legs and feet. Doctors said he might never walk again. However, O'Brady made a full recovery, and 18 months after his accident, he competed in his first triathlon. After that, he continued to push his body to the limit, eventually becoming a professional endurance athlete. His many athletic accomplishments included skiing to the North Pole, and reaching the top of Mount Everest.
Another goal O'Brady had set for himself was becoming the first to cross Antarctica unassisted. Just a few days before beginning this challenge, O'Brady met British explorer Louis Rudd, who was also attempting the crossing. The men decided to race each other across the frozen continent, both starting out on November 3.
Explorers had crossed the Antarctic alone before, but with help; some were given supplies along the way. Others used dogs or giant kites attached to their sleds to propel them forward. But O'Brady pulled his own sled with around 180 kilograms of supplies. This included 280 specially-made nutrition bars - more than half of his food - to fuel his body for the trek.
O'Brady skied approximately 12 hours per day, sometimes in temperatures of -62�C. He skied 1,482 kilometers in 53 days - beating Rudd by two days. During his journey, O'Brady posted daily selfies on social media, and spoke with supporters (such as musician Paul Simon) on his satellite phone. He named his expedition "The Impossible First" to inspire others. He said, "I've been preparing my mind, my body, my spirit, for something they say is impossible, to show you that nothing is impossible."

A woman in a green leotard completes her routine on the balance beam, gracefully dismounts, and starts waving to cheering fans. Although it's not the Olympics, the woman, who turned 93 on her last birthday, is a competitive gymnast. Her name is Johanna Quaas.
"It all started when I was a young girl," says Quaas, remembering her childhood in Germany. "I grew up surrounded by sports." She recalls being in love with gymnastics and playing on the equipment at a local playground - climbing on the bars and rolling on the mats. Quaas began participating in gymnastics competitions when she was ten years old. But her family moved to a different part of the country, forcing her training to stop. Then, World War II began.
After the war, East Germany discouraged individual sports in favor of team sports, so Quaas took a break from gymnastics. She started playing handball, and was on the team that won the Eastern German Championship in 1954. As the years passed, Quaas became a physical education teacher, and in 1961, started coaching gymnastics. Two of Quaas's gymnasts competed in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Additionally, Quaas helped train coaches and co-authored a gymnastics textbook. Along the way, she married another gymnastics coach, Gerhard Quaas, and they had three children. "Unfortunately, my own children did not become gymnasts," she says with a smile.
In 1982, at the age of fifty-seven, Quaas decided to try competing again. That same year, Quaas won a regional competition, and eleven medals later, she's still going strong. "My proudest moment so far was when I was 84 years old and there was no one in my age group competing in the championships. So, they put me with the others in the 70-75 age group, and I still won by one point," she says. Quaas was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records  as the world's oldest gymnast in 2012, when she was 86 years old.
Quaas is still competing today. "My face is old but my heart is young," says the great-grandmother, who lives in Halle, Germany. Do you want to see Quaas in action? Her gymnastics videos have gone viral - one has more than eight million hits!

Roberta Marongiu is a boxing coach for an organization called Rock Steady Boxing (RSB). RSB isn't for professional boxers. In fact, many of Marongiu's boxers are older than 60. RSB is for people with a serious illness - Parkinson's disease (PD).
PD makes a person's muscles weaker over time. This makes it hard for the person to balance and walk. People with PD also shake from tremors. There's no cure for PD, though medication can reduce tremors. After a while, however, PD medications stop working well. Some medications have bad side effects.
But a new study shows that doing high-intensity exercise, like boxing drills, helps people with PD. In RSB classes, people don't fight each other. They do boxing moves and exercises. For example, they punch a punching bag. Punching makes their muscles stronger and reduces tremors. Doing different boxing moves stops PD symptoms from getting worse. Boxing classes for people with PD are very popular. As one person with PD says, "I would box all day if I could!"

"Give me all you got! Come on!" shouts Roberta Marongiu. Marongiu is a boxing coach. But she doesn't train professional boxers. Marongiu is part of a nonprofit organization called Rock Steady Boxing (RSB). In RSB, people with Parkinson's disease practice boxing moves.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is an illness that slowly damages the body's nervous system. As the disease gets worse, muscles weaken, so people with PD have less motor control. Other symptoms of PD include tremors, stiff muscles, and balance problems, making it difficult to walk. Although there's no cure yet for PD, medication does relieve symptoms. Unfortunately, the medications become less effective over time. And they can have unpleasant side effects.
But there's good news. A recent study from Northwestern University, in Illinois, USA, shows that high-intensity exercise helps people with early-stage PD. One of these sports is non-contact boxing. In fact, non-contact boxing, like RSB, is one of the best types of sports for people with PD. This is because the workout is complex, repetitive, and intense.
During an RSB class, participants (usually aged 45 - 92) do a series of boxing moves and exercises. Each exercise works on specific skills. For example, participants punch a punching bag to increase strength, improve coordination, and decrease tremors. They practice boxing footwork to improve balance. The workout helps keep PD symptoms from getting worse.
Today, there are more than 500 RSB programs around the world, and other organizations have started PD boxing programs, too. People with PD are reporting how much better they feel after boxing. As one PD boxer says, "I would box all day if I could!"

"Give me all you got! Come on!" shouts boxing coach Roberta Marongiu to her boxers. Though it may sound like Marongiu is working with professionals, her trainees aren't the typical boxers you'll find at a boxing gym. Marongiu works for a program called Rock Steady Boxing (RSB). RSB uses professional boxing techniques to help people living with Parkinson's disease improve their quality of life.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive illness that slowly damages the body's nervous system. As the disease advances, muscles weaken and motor control decreases. People with PD develop symptoms, such as tremors and stiff muscles. They also have balance problems, making walking more difficult. Although there is no cure yet for PD, medication does relieve symptoms. Unfortunately, the medications become less effective over time, and may have unpleasant side effects.
In the past, people with PD were encouraged to do moderate exercise. But a recent study from Northwestern University, in Illinois, USA, showed that people with early-stage PD can benefit from high-intensity workouts, three times a week. "It's part of the idea that exercise is medicine," says Daniel Corcos, a professor of physical therapy and co-author of the study. One of the best types of sports for those with PD is, surprisingly, boxing - non-contact boxing. Boxing is a complex, repetitive, and intense sport. It builds strength, flexibility, speed, and confidence.
Rock Steady Boxing, founded in 2006, is a nonprofit organization whose mission it is to empower people with PD. During an RSB class, participants (generally aged 45- 92) do a series of boxing moves, each targeting a specific skill. For example, they punch a punching bag to increase strength and hand-eye coordination, and to steady tremors. They do footwork to help improve balance. These boxing workouts keep their PD symptoms from getting worse.
Today there are more than 500 RSB programs around the world, and other organizations have started PD boxing programs, too. People with PD are enthusiastically reporting how much better boxing makes them feel. As one participant raves, "I would box all day if I could!"




The Perfect Wave
Sport
Most surfers dream of the "perfect wave". Zach Weisberg found his perfect wave more than 170 kilometers from the nearest ocean! "I don't think I've ever surfed a wave that good. I wanted to just surf that wave all day!" raves Weisberg, founder of The Inertia an online, digital community for surfing. But Weisberg isn't describing a wave off the coast of Fiji, Tahiti or any other world-famous surf spot. His wave was produced at the largest man-made wave pool in history - the World Surfing League (WSL) Surf Ranch.
The WSL Surf Ranch is the brainchild of American surfer Kelly Slater, an eleven-time world champion. At age fourteen, Slater visited a wave pool in Texas, USA, and became inspired. He wondered what technology would be necessary to create the perfect artificial wave. In 2006, Slater started working with Adam Fincham, an aerospace engineer from the University of Southern California. With a little help from supercomputers, Slater and Fincham transformed a former water skiing lake in the rural town of Lemoore, California, USA, into a wave pool. By 2015, the first prototype of the pool was ready, and a video of Slater surfing at the ranch was released on social media.
The ranch's rectangular lake is 700 meters long and 150 meters wide. A hydrofoil, which is a one-hundred-ton blade, shaped like a small airplane wing, produces the waves. The blade moves on a track along the lake at up to 30 kilometers per hour. This motion creates waves almost two meters high, lasting about one minute and coming every five minutes. More than 50 types of waves can be made by the mechanism. And, what's more, the system is completely powered by solar energy.
Some critics believe that artificial waves are actually too perfect; they find the technology intrusive to the sport of surfing. But perfection doesn't appear to bother Australia's Olympic surfing team. The team will train at the ranch in preparation for the 2020 Olympics - when surfing will be included in the Olympics for the first time. As of now, the WSL Surf Ranch is only for professional surfers. But get your surfboard ready, because WSL is opening a pool for the public in Florida, USA, in the near future. "Surf's up!"

The system is completely powered by solar energy.
Some surfers think that using technology will harm the sport. But Australia's Olympic surfing team doesn't seem worried. Surfing will be included in the Olympics for the first time in 2020, and the Australian team will be training at the ranch. For now, the WSL Surf Ranch is only for professional surfers. But WSL will soon be opening a wave pool for the public in Florida, USA. See you on the waves!

Kelly Slater loves surfing on ocean waves. He won many surfing contests all over the world. Now, he's famous. But Slater wanted to make his own waves. So, he created a big wave pool. It's called the World Surfing League (WSL) Surf Ranch.
The Surf Ranch is 170 kilometers away from the ocean. It's in California, USA. Slater worked with a scientist named Adam Fincham to design the pool. The huge pool is 700 meters long and 150 meters wide. A large blade pushes the water through the pool to make the waves. The blade moves very fast. It makes waves almost two meters high. Solar energy makes the blade move.
Australia's Olympic surfing team will train for the 2020 Olympics at the Surf Ranch. It will be the first Olympics with a surfing contest. The Surf Ranch in California is only for professional surfers. But Slater is building another wave pool for the public in Florida, USA. So, come surfing!

Eshetu wasn't always a running coach. He used to work as a gym teacher. One day, Eshetu saw Olympic potential in one of his students, Derartu Tulu. Eshetu began training Tulu for the 1992 Olympic Games, according to his own specially-designed program. In 1992, Tulu won the gold medal for the women's 10,000-meter run. She was the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal. Since then, Eshetu has trained hundreds of other runners. More than a dozen of them have gone on to win Olympic medals.
 
Eshetu's trainees wake up early for two-hour training sessions, five times a week. They run through the forests and hills of Bekoji. They also run the 400-meter course in the town's stadium. Eshetu discusses runners' mistakes and gives them advice. Trainees eat carbohydrate-rich foods, like wheat and potatoes. They drink besso, a drink made from barley. Eshetu makes sure they have good hygiene, and that they get enough rest.
Life is difficult for Eshetu's runners, but Eshetu believes this makes them stronger, and more able to succeed.

Running Towards a Dream
Sport
"Sport for health! Sport for victory!" chant a group of teenage athletes as they end their training session in the middle of a forest. Welcome to Bekoji, Ethiopia - a.k.a. "The Town of Runners".
The small town of Bekoji sits among green hills 2,800 meters above sea level, and 250 kilometers south of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. Although most professional Ethiopian athletes train in Addis Ababa, their initial training takes place in more remote, rural areas of the country, like Bekoji. Many families in Bekoji live in poverty, surviving by herding cattle and farming grain. Competitive, long-distance running provides an opportunity for athletes to improve their lives. Successful runners can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from sponsorships and prize money. "Athletics in Bekoji is more than sport. It is a way to escape poverty, which undeniably causes athletes to even work harder," says running coach Sintayehu Eshetu.
Eshetu has discovered and trained many of Ethiopia's most successful long-distance runners. While working as a gym teacher at a local school, he spotted potential in one of his students, Derartu Tulu. "There was nothing she wouldn't do to win," he remembers. Eshetu began to train Tulu according to his own specially-designed program. In 1992, Tulu became the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal, when she won the women's 10,000-meter run.
Eshetu's runners wake up at dawn for two-hour training sessions, five times a week. Trainees drink besso, a local drink made from barley, a grain that is high in carbohydrates. Eshetu discusses runners' mistakes and gives them advice. Trainees run on the 400-meter course in the town's stadium, and through the forests and hills of Bekoji. Eshetu makes sure his trainees have good hygiene, eat foods with carbohydrates, such as wheat and potatoes, and rest when they're not training.
Eshetu is obviously on the right track. Since 1992, more than a dozen of Eshetu's runners have gone on to win Olympic medals. Today, Eshetu wants to make sure that enough new coaches are being trained to carry on his program.
Living in poverty, Eshetu's runners face a lot of difficulties. But Eshetu believes this allows them to become stronger and more able to succeed.





What are your favorite events in the Olympic Games? Figure skating? Downhill skiing? Swimming? Now, a new event is being considered for inclusion in the Olympics, but not one you might expect. The event is competitive video gaming, or "esports".  And some people are up in arms.
Michael Payne, former marketing director of the International Olympic Committee says, "The Olympics has always been about physical action, not just mental, and it's why chess and other intellect games have never been accepted."
Many Olympians feel the same way. "The mental side of esports can be tough," admits Ted Ligety, an alpine skier and Olympic gold medalist, "...but the Olympics is where you have to do some sort of a physical exertion."
Professional gamers insist, however, that playing esports requires both mental and physical skill. In the war game StarCraft II, players may perform over 500 actions a minute, as one hand controls the mouse and the other hand clicks away on the keyboard. "If the athletes saw how we actually compete, how we practice, how much effort we put in our daily routines to get better," says professional gamer Ilyes Satouri from France, "I think they could only respect the efforts we put into it."
Like Olympians, professional gamers spend their days training, often 8 to 15 hours a day. This includes a physical workout. Many gamers work with nutritionists and physical trainers. Physical trainers work with gamers on posture, reflexes, and endurance.
Are audiences really interested in watching people play video games? The answer is yes. Competitive gaming attracts tens of millions of spectators watching online and filling stadiums around the world. Esports today are a $1.5 billion business. It's no wonder including esports in the Olympics is so tempting. Its inclusion would greatly increase viewership.
Another benefit to including esports is the type of spectator they will attract. Olympic organizers have been trying to find ways to get younger people interested in the Olympics. That's why they've included skateboarding, sports climbing, and surfing in the 2020 Olympic Games. Esports will also accomplish this goal.
While the debate continues, esports have already been accepted into the 2022 Asian Games, the world's second largest multi-sport event (after the Olympics). Will the Olympic Games be next?

Esports in the Olympics?
Sport
A new event might be coming to the Olympic Games. But its players don't run, jump, or swim. The new event is competitive video gaming, or "esports". If the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decides to include it, esports may become an event in the 2024 Olympic Games. The question is, do esports really belong in the Olympics?
"The Olympics has always been about physical action, not just mental," says Michael Payne, who used to work for the IOC, "and it's why chess and other intellect games have never been accepted." Many Olympians agree. The Olympics is where you have to do some sort of a physical exertion," says Ted Ligety, an Olympic downhill skier.
Professional gamers, however, say that playing esports does require physical skill. In the war game StarCraft II, professional players do about 500 actions every minute. One hand controls the mouse while the other hand presses keys on the keyboard. Like Olympians, professional gamers spend their days training, often 8 to 15 hours a day. This includes physical exercise. Many gamers work with personal trainers and nutritionists to improve their game. Personal trainers work with esports players on posture, reflexes, and endurance.
There are benefits to including esports in the Olympics. First, esports will attract more viewers. Esports are already a $1.5 billion business, and attract tens of millions of spectators. Second, esports will encourage younger viewers to watch the Olympics. Most esports spectators are between the ages of 25 and 34.

Soon, the Olympic Games might have a new kind of competition. It's a video game competition. Video game competitions are called esports. The IOC (International Olympic Committee) is the group deciding whether to include esports in the Olympics.
Many people say esports don't belong in the Olympics. Michael Payne used to work for the IOC. He says that the Olympics is for physical sports. He says esports use your mind, not your body.
But professional gamers say esports are physical. When gamers play esports, their hands move very quickly. In the game StarCraft II, gamers do about 500 actions every minute. Professional gamers train 8 to 15 hours a day, like Olympians. Many gamers do exercises to help their reflexes and endurance. Gamers also work with nutritionists to make sure they eat right.
Esports can help the Olympics. Millions of people watch esports, so millions of people will watch esports in the Olympics. Most esports viewers are young, so more young people will watch the Olympics.

How High Can You Pogo?
Sport
Have you ever heard of a children's toy called a pogo stick? A traditional pogo stick has a pole with handles near the top. There's also a spring to help it bounce. Riders hold the handles, stand on footrests near the bottom of the pogo stick and start jumping. Now, there is a sport called extreme pogo, or Xpogo. Xpogo athletes use a special pogo stick to jump, do tricks and "fly" through the air! How? An extreme pogo stick uses compressed air. This helps riders jump more than two meters high!
Nick Ryan is one of the founders of the sport of Xpogo. After he got his first pogo stick when he was a boy, he learned how to do tricks. He made videos and put them on the Internet. There, he connected with other pogo stick riders. When extreme pogo sticks became available in 2004, riders were able to jump higher and do more thrilling tricks. Today, Ryan's company, Xpogo LLC, promotes Xpogo through competitions and exhibitions. Ryan says he wants people "to engage with pogo sticks in a totally different way ... not as toys but as a sports lifestyle."
Each year, Xpogo has an event called Pogopalooza. The first Pogopalooza took place in Nebraska, USA, in 2004 with only six athletes. Today, hundreds of athletes compete in front of thousands of people, in cities across the USA.

A traditional pogo stick consists of a pole with handles near the top to hold onto and footrests near the bottom to stand on. There's a spring that gives the pogo stick its bounce. But in 2004, the first extreme pogo sticks became available. An extreme pogo stick adds a cylinder with compressed air or other mechanism to launch the rider more than two meters into the air!
Nick Ryan is one of the founders of Xpogo. He became a pogo enthusiast after receiving a pogo stick for Christmas when he was a boy. Soon, he was doing tricks with his new toy in his backyard, and posting videos of himself online. Then, Ryan discovered other "pogoers" doing their own tricks. When extreme pogo sticks became available, the pogoers were able to jump higher, and do more exciting stunts. After college, Ryan co-founded Xpogo LLC, a company that promotes the sport through competitions and exhibitions. Ryan says he wanted people "to engage with pogo sticks in a totally different way, different than they had for ... a hundred years, not as toys but as a sports lifestyle."
In 2004, the first Pogopalooza competition took place in Nebraska, USA, with six participants. The goal was to let the athletes meet, compete, and share tricks.  Pogopalooza has since grown to become an annual multi-city event with hundreds of athletes and tens of thousands of spectators. They compete, have exhibitions, and set new world records.

Badwater - The Hardest Footrace
Sport
Running a marathon is tough. Running an ultramarathon is tougher. But running the Badwater 135 ultramarathon is the toughest of all. In fact, this grueling race is often referred to as "The World's Toughest Footrace". 

Badwater 135 is a race of extremes. First, there's the distance. The race is 135 miles long, which is the reason it's called Badwater 135. That's equal to 217 kilometers, the length of five marathons! The race is also non-stop; runners take only short naps.

Next, there's the mountainous terrain. The race begins in the lowest spot in North America - Badwater, in Death Valley, California. From there, runners race up and down three mountain ranges until they reach the base of Mount Whitney, one of the highest mountains in the US. Just the base is 2,530 meters high!

Finally, there's the weather. Death Valley is the hottest spot in the US. Road signs read, "Caution! Extreme heat. Danger!" Plus, the race takes place in July, the hottest month in Death Valley, when temperatures can reach 54� Celsius. The hot roads even melt runners' shoes! But runners need to be prepared for cold, too. Nighttime runners heading to the finish line will experience freezing temperatures at the foot of Mount Whitney.

Runners of Badwater 135 can't succeed alone. Each runner has his or her own support crew of up to four people, who ride along in a vehicle. The crew provides the runner with food, water, ice, medical supplies, clothing, and physical and emotional support. Members of the crew often run along with the runner, to help him or her keep a good pace.

Surprisingly, many people are interested in running this extreme race. But only about 100 people are accepted each year. Runners must be serious, experienced ultramarathon runners. And even so, not everyone makes it to the end.

Badwater winners are those who finish the race within 48 hours. The prize? A Badwater Ultramarathon belt buckle. But runners walk away with a lot more than a buckle. As Jodi Weiss, a past Badwater winner writes, "Badwater 135... presents you with the opportunity to discover all of the amazing things that you just may be capable of."

Badwater - The Hardest Footrace
Sport
Running a marathon is hard. Running an ultramarathon is harder. But running the Badwater 135 ultramarathon is the hardest. People call this race, "The World's Toughest Footrace".

What makes Badwater 135 so tough? The first thing is the distance. The race is called Badwater 135 because it's 135 miles long. That's 217 kilometers - as long as five marathons! The race is also non-stop. Runners run day and night.

Secondly, there are mountains. Badwater 135 begins at the lowest spot in North America - Badwater Basin, in Death Valley, California. From there, racers run up and down across three mountain ranges. They finish at a height of 2,530 meters, at the base of Mount Whitney, one of the highest mountains in the United States.

Finally, it's hot! Death Valley is the hottest spot in the USA. And the race takes place in July, when temperatures are highest. It can get as hot as 54�C. The hot roads can even melt runners' shoes!

Each Badwater runner brings his or her own support crew of up to four people. The crew helps the runner physically and emotionally. They ride along in a car, which has the runner's food, water, ice, medical supplies, and clothing. Someone from the crew often runs along with the runner, to help keep a good pace.

Only about 100 people are chosen to run Badwater 135 every year. Runners must have a lot of experience running ultramarathons. Runners who finish the race within 48 hours are winners. They win a Badwater belt buckle. They also win something else - the chance to see how much they were able to accomplish.

Badwater - The Hardest Footrace
Sport
You are running in a hot desert. You're running up mountains. You're running for a long time. That's what it's like to run the Badwater 135 ultramarathon.

Badwater 135 starts in Badwater, a place in Death Valley, California. It's the lowest place in North America. But the footrace ends high in the mountains. The race is 135 miles long - 217 kilometers. That's as long as five marathons!

The race goes through Death Valley, the hottest place in the USA. And the race in July, the hottest month. During the race, temperatures can reach 54�C.

Each runner has a crew. Their job is to help the runner. Crews have two to four people and a car. They drive along with the runner. They give the runner food, water, and ice. Sometimes members of the crew run with the runner. They do this to help the runner with his or her pace.

Runners who finish the race in 48 hours or less are winners. Winners get a Badwater 135 belt buckle. They also "win" the knowledge that they succeeded.




Taking a Ride Down a Volcano
Sport
Do you like snowboarding? If you do, you can try something new. You can try volcano boarding. In this sport, you slide down the side of a volcano!

Cerro Negro is the best volcano for volcano boarding. Cerro Negro is near the city of Leon, in Nicaragua. Very small rocks cover the volcano. The rocks look like black sand. The rocks can be very sharp.

Volcano boarders walk 45-minutes up Cerro Negro. They carry goggles, gloves, and a special suit. These protect the boarders when they slide down the mountain. The boarders also carry a volcano board. It looks like a sled.  It is wood with a thin piece of metal on the bottom. Boarders can stand on the board or they can sit on it. The board has a rope. Boarders hold onto the rope as they speed down the mountain. They can move up to 95 kph!

Thousands of people go to Cerro Negro each year to try volcano boarding. Do you want to try this unusual sport?

Taking a Ride Down a Volcano
Sport
Imagine sliding down the side of an active volcano on a wooden board. This unusual sport is called volcano boarding. Does that sound terrifying or exciting?

Cerro Negro is a volcano outside the city of Leon, Nicaragua. It is one of Central America's youngest volcanoes, and one of Nicaragua's most active. Volcanic rock that looks like black sand covers the mountain. This makes it the perfect place for volcano boarding. 

A volcano boarding adventure begins with a 45-minute hike up Cerro Negro. You have a one-piece suit, goggles, and gloves. These will protect you as you slide down the mountain, because the volcanic stones can be very sharp. You also carry a volcano board. It looks like a sled and is made out of wood. A thin layer of metal covers the bottom. You can either stand on the board like a snowboard, or sit on it like a sled. The board has a rope to hold onto as you speed down the mountain. And you better hold on tight! Timothy Brauning, who leads Cerro Negro volcano boarding trips, explains why: "Because of the surface of the volcano and the weather conditions constant at this volcano, we are able to slide down at speeds up to 95 kph."

In 2004, Daryn Webb came up with the idea for volcano boarding from his experiences sandboarding in Australia. He tried many different versions of the volcano board, including a mattress and a door. Eventually, he designed a board that worked. This design is the volcano board people use today.

Thousands of travelers go to Cerro Negro each year to experience volcano boarding. Would you like to take the trip?

Imagine racing down the side of an active volcano. To some it may sound terrifying, but to others, it may be the experience of a lifetime. This sport is called volcano boarding. Cerro Negro (Black Mountain) is a volcano outside the city of Leon, Nicaragua. It is one of Central America's youngest volcanoes, and one of Nicaragua's most active. It is covered in small grains of volcanic rock, making it the perfect destination for volcano boarding. 

Your adventure begins with a 45-minute hike up the 728-meter mountain side. You have a one-piece suit, goggles, and gloves, to provide protection as you slide down the mountain. The volcanic stones break apart easily and can be very sharp. You're also carrying your volcano board. The wooden board is the shape of a sled. The bottom is covered with a thin layer of metal and a piece of plastic to give you extra speed. The board also has a rope to hold onto as you careen down the mountain.

There are two different ways to volcano board down the mountain. You can stand on the board like a snowboard, or sit on it like a sled. Prepare to move fast! Timothy Brauning, who leads volcano boarding trips, explains, "Because of the surface of the volcano and the weather conditions constant at this volcano, we are able to slide down at speeds up to 95 kph."

Volcano boarding was first developed by Daryn Webb in 2004. He grew up sandboarding in Australia and realized that something similar might be possible on Cerro Negro. He tried many different versions of the volcano board, including a mattress, the door to his house, and even a mini-fridge!  "The first and second attempts were disasters," he says. "I fell at least 30 times and had cuts everywhere." Eventually, he designed a board that worked. This design is the board that volcano boarders still use today.

Cerro Negro has become a main attraction for adventurers and has improved the economy of the city of Leon. Every year, thousands of travelers now venture to Cerro Negro to experience the unusual sport of volcano boarding. Would you be interested in taking the trip?





Studies have shown that dancing has many health benefits, including strengthening your heart, muscles and mind. Even people who use a wheelchair can still dance. It's called wheelchair dancing. You may not have heard of this sport before, but it's been around for nearly 50 years!
Wheelchair dancing began in Sweden in 1968 as a way to help people in wheelchairs with rehabilitation, and also as a way to have fun. Els-Britt Larsson Freijd, a Swedish woman who used a wheelchair, is considered the "pioneer" of wheelchair dancing. She was part of committees which worked to get wheelchair dancing recognized as an official sport. In 1975, 30 couples competed in the first wheelchair dancing competition in Vasteras, Sweden. Then, in 1977, Sweden hosted the first international competition. The sport spread around the world, and now there are wheelchair dancers in more than 29 countries, including Japan, Poland, and Mexico. In recent years, the increasing number of dance shows on TV has boosted the sport's popularity.
Wheelchair dancing allows people to express themselves through many different styles of dance. Ballroom dance styles, such as the tango, waltz, and cha-cha, are very popular. Many wheelchair dancers do it strictly for enjoyment. Others enter competitions where dancers can wear elaborate costumes. Wheelchair dancers use either manual wheelchairs propelled by hand, or electric wheelchairs. There is a type of wheelchair dancing to fit every person. Group dances can be freestyle (dancers do any dance moves they want) or synchronized. Some dancers prefer to perform solo. Others enjoy dancing with a partner. Two dancers using wheelchairs can dance together, or one dancer in a wheelchair can dance with a standing partner.
The sport is continuing to evolve. Choreographer Merry Lynn Morris has patented a special wheelchair she designed just for wheelchair dancers. Today, you can find wheelchair dancing organizations all over the world. Infinite Flow, America's first professional wheelchair ballroom dance company, was founded by Marisa Hamamoto in Los Angeles, USA, in 2015. Hamamoto believes "Whether you have two left feet or two left wheels, we all have a dancer inside of us."
Who knows where this sport will roll off to next!

Underwater Cycling
Sport
Do you like being in the swimming pool? Do you like bike riding? Put them together, and you get a new sport - "aqua cycling"!
Aqua cycling is riding an exercise bike in a swimming pool. The bike doesn't move. You don't need to swim to get to the bike - you can walk. The water is only four feet (1.2 meters)  deep. When a person sits on the bike, the top part of their body is above the water. People go to aqua cycling classes to exercise. They wear swimsuits and special rubber shoes. A teacher tells people when to sit or stand while pedaling. Doctors think aqua cycling is good for older people. Why? If they fall off a bike, they are safe in the swimming pool. Also, people who do aqua cycling get stronger. Yet there isn't a lot of pressure on their joints.
So, join an aqua cycling class, and pedal your way to better health!

Do you enjoy spending time in the swimming pool? What about bike riding? Put these two activities together, and you have a new sport - "aqua cycling"!
Aqua cycling is riding a stationary exercise bike in a swimming pool. You don't need to know how to swim to do it, because the bikes are under only four feet (1.2 meters) of water. So, while you're pedaling, only the lower part of your body is submerged. Besides, aqua cycling instructors are usually lifeguards, too.
During a 45-minute class, participants (wearing swimsuits) pedal their bikes while sitting and standing. Special rubber shoes help stop their feet from slipping off the pedals.
Aqua cycling started in Italy as a way to help athletes with injured knees. Then, it became a fitness trend in Europe. The first American underwater cycling studio opened in New York City, USA, in 2013.
A study presented in 2012 showed that an underwater workout is almost equal to a workout on land. "If you can't train on land, you can train in the water and have the same benefits," says Dr. Martin Juneau, Director of Prevention at the Montreal Heart Institute.
Riding a bike under water increases muscle strength. And because the water supports your weight, you aren't putting too much pressure on your joints. Also, some people are afraid of falling off a bike and getting hurt. That isn't a problem when you're in water. Instead of falling off the bike - you float off!
So find the closest aqua cycling class, and start pedaling your way to health!

Swimming is great way to build muscle strength. So is biking. Put the two together, and you have an excellent and unusual workout - "aqua cycling"!
Aqua cycling is riding an exercise bike in a swimming pool. The benefit of exercising in water is that water supports your weight; this reduces stress on your joints. As a result, aqua cycling increases your muscle strength without putting pressure on your joints.
Because it's easy on the joints, aqua cycling is a good choice for people who want to exercise but move more slowly due to aging or arthritis. It's also a good choice for older people afraid of falling. The buoyant water will prevent injury. But aqua cycling isn't only for older people or those with joint pain. It's great for everyone. Aside from helping to increase muscle strength, aqua cycling increases bone strength, burns calories, and is good for the heart.
In an aqua cycling class, several waterproof bikes are submerged in four feet (1.2 meters) of water. The upper part of the cyclist's body is above water while sitting on the bike. Even people who can't swim can do aqua cycling since the water is not very deep. Besides, most aqua cycling instructors are also lifeguards.
During class, an instructor guides participants as they pedal their bikes - while in sitting and standing positions. Special rubber shoes help keep cyclists' feet steady on the pedals. Riders can burn up to 800 calories during a 45- minute aqua cycling class. Aqua cycling doesn't leave riders with sore muscles the next day. But just because you don't feel pain, doesn't mean you're not getting a good workout. In fact, a study presented in 2012 showed that people who cycled underwater had just about the same workout as people using stationary exercise bikes on land, just without the aches.
.
Aqua cycling originated in Italy as a type of physical therapy for athletes suffering from knee injuries. It gradually spread throughout Europe, becoming a fitness trend. The first U.S. underwater cycling studio opened in New York City, in 2013. 
So, find an aqua cycle class near you, and start pedaling your way to health!




The Invictus Games
Sport
Many soldiers around the world become injured while in the military. And many have a long road to recovery. Veterans struggle to find ways to live with disabilities caused by their injuries. To help themselves heal, both mentally and physically, some veterans get involved in sports competitions.
Prince Harry of England was in the British military for ten years. During that time, he flew helicopters. Sometimes, he flew injured soldiers to military hospitals. Prince Harry still helps injured soldiers today. In 2014, he created the "Invictus Games," a sports competition for soldiers and veterans with disabilities.
The word invictus is Latin for "unconquered" or "undefeated." This name highlights the unbeatable spirit of the injured veterans. The games are a place where veterans can see for themselves, and show others, what they can achieve after injury.
Prince Harry got the idea for the Invictus Games after attending the "'Warrior Games"' in Colorado, USA in 2013. The Warrior Games is a sports competition for soldiers and veterans with disabilities. After attending the games, Prince Harry was inspired to create something similar back home in England. Prince Harry considers the Invictus Games a way to say thank you to "the people who serve our country and put themselves in harm's way so we don't have to."
In September 2014, the first Invictus Games were held for four days in London, England. Teams of injured veterans from 13 different countries participated in sporting events. Four hundred people competed in nine events, including cycling, sitting volleyball, swimming, and wheelchair basketball. In the future, the games will be held in other countries, with more participants, and even more events.
Training for the Invictus Games keeps participants physically active after being injured. One "unconquered" participant, Maurillia Simpson, says that when her British Army career ended after a leg injury, she felt she had nothing else to live for. But her thoughts changed after she participated in the 2015 Invictus Games. Today, Simpson says, "If you are breathing and have that breath of life in you, there is a purpose." For Simpson, playing in the games is "the beginning of a new dream."

Many soldiers around the world become injured while in the military. Veterans need time to heal - emotionally and physically. Participating in sports competitions can help. Prince Harry of England was in the British military for ten years. During that time, he took many injured soldiers by helicopter to military hospitals. After the army, he decided to help soldiers and veterans with disabilities. In 2014, Prince Harry created a sports event called the "Invictus Games."
How did Prince Harry think of the idea? In 2013, he went to the "Warrior Games," in Colorado, USA. The Warrior Games is a sports competition for soldiers and veterans with disabilities. Prince Harry decided to create something similar back home in England. He called them the Invictus Games because invictus means "unconquered" or "undefeated" in Latin. This name highlights the unbeatable spirit of the injured veterans.
The first Invictus Games were in London, England, in 2014. Teams of injured soldiers from 13 different countries participated for four days. There were nine sporting events, including cycling, sitting volleyball, swimming, and wheelchair basketball.
Getting ready for the Invictus Games keeps participants physically active after being injured. One "unconquered" veteran, Maurillia Simpson, says that when her British Army career ended, after a leg injury, she felt she had nothing else to live for. But then Simpson competed in the Invictus Games, and she found new goals to reach for. "If you are breathing and have that breath of life in you, there is a purpose," she says. For Simpson, the Invictus Games are "the beginning of a new dream."

Sport
Prince Harry of England was in the army for ten years. He flew a helicopter. Sometimes he flew soldiers with injuries to the hospital.
Prince Harry still helps soldiers with injuries. He started a special sports competition - the "'Invictus Games," for soldiers with disabilities. Invictus means "unbeatable." The Invictus Games show what people with disabilities can do, and not what they can't do.
The first Invictus Games were in 2014, in London, England. Thirteen countries competed. All the players were soldiers with disabilities. The teams played sports for four days. There were nine sports events. Two of the events were swimming and wheelchair basketball.
Maurillia Simpson was a soldier. She had a bad leg injury, and had to leave the army. Simpson says that at first, she felt she had nothing else to live for. But she played in the 2015 Invictus Games, and it helped her find a purpose. "It is the beginning of a new dream...," says Simpson. "It's a new life for me now."

Go Team Green!
Sport
All over the world, people come to stadiums to cheer for their favorite sports teams. However, with thousands of fans, comes the many tons of trash they leave behind. Today, more and more sports stadiums around the world are trying to reduce waste and use less electricity and water. They're "going green."
The Green Sports Alliance, founded in 2010, helps sports stadiums become more eco-friendly. The organization works with more than 300 sports teams and stadiums in 14 countries. One of the organization's co-founders, Allen Hershkowitz, says stadiums he works with now use at least 25 percent less energy. Stadium managers get excited about saving the environment - and tens of millions of dollars, too.

The Philadelphia Eagles were one of the first teams to have a green stadium. Every time the Philadelphia Eagles play football in Pennsylvania, USA, more than 68,000 fans arrive at the stadium. In 2004, stadium management started recycling and composting. The stadium's paper products can be recycled, and the utensils (made from corn) can be composted. That means that almost none of the stadium's trash is sent to a landfill.

The Eagles' stadium also uses solar panels - as do stadiums in Brazil, India, Taiwan, Italy, and other countries. Solar panels use energy from the sun to create electricity. In Ohio and Texas, USA, there are some stadiums that use windmills in addition to solar panels for electricity. Electricity from these renewable resources can be used in stadiums to power lights, television screens, refrigerators, and scoreboards.
Conserving water is another way stadiums can become more eco-friendly. For example, stadiums in Minnesota, USA and Melbourne, Australia collect rainwater in huge containers. The water is used to irrigate the grass on the stadiums' fields. It can also be used for cleaning, and in the stadiums' bathrooms. Using rainwater helps stadiums save more water each year.
Hopefully, the trend of green sports stadiums will continue worldwide. Green sports stadiums may even inspire communities to go green, too!

People all over the world love sports. Sometimes they watch sport games in stadiums. In these stadiums, people make a lot of trash. The stadium also uses a lot of lights and water. Many stadiums today are "going green." How do they do it?
The Philadelphia Eagles are an American football team. Their stadium is in Pennsylvania, USA. It was one of the first stadiums to go green. The stadium recycles almost all its trash. For example, you can recycle your food wrapper after you finish eating. The stadium also has a special device that uses the sun to make electricity. The stadium uses this electricity for their lights. This saves energy and money.
Stadiums in other parts of the world are also trying to go green. A stadium in Melbourne, Australia is saving water in an interesting way. When it rains, the water goes into special boxes. They use this water for the stadium's grass. People also use the rainwater to clean the stadium.
What are some other ways stadiums can go green?




Festivals, Food, and Fun

Every year there are festivals all over the world. The festivals have traditional foods. They have entertainment, and sports!
Each July, in Mongolia, people meet at the "Naadam" festival. At Naadam, there are three main sports - archery, wrestling, and horse racing. Children ages 6 to 12 race the horses! The fastest horse gets a gold medal. The slowest horse gets something, too. People sing it a special song!
From May to September, Scotland has the "Highland Games." In some games, players wear kilts, and throw heavy objects. They throw hammers, large rocks, and even trees! There is also a haggis eating contest. Haggis is a traditional food in Scotland. The person who finishes his or her haggis first, wins.
In May, in Hong Kong, people enjoy the "Cheung Chau Bun Festival." At the festival, there is a tower that is 50-feet high. On the tower, there are lots and lots of buns. People race up the tower. As they climb, they put as many buns as they can in their bags.
These festivals have unusual sports. Which sport seems like the most fun to you?

There are many interesting festivals around the world that take place once a year. Many include traditional sports events.
Every July, people across Mongolia celebrate Mongolian independence with the "Naadam" festival. They dress in colorful costumes, and eat special Mongolian foods. Naadam starts with a big parade. After the parade, there are two days of traditional competitions: horse racing, archery, and wrestling. Bareback horse racing is the most popular sport. Jockeys are as young as six years old. In the past, only men competed in the Naadam competitions. Today, women compete, too.
If you visit Scotland in the spring or summer, be sure to go to the "Highland Games." From May to September, people gather to celebrate Scottish culture. The festival includes bagpipe and dancing contests. There are many sports events. The caber toss is the most well-known event. Contestants, called "tossers," throw cabers. Cabers are tree trunks that are wide at one end and narrow at the other end. They are over nine feet tall and weigh 175 pounds. The tossers wear kilts, traditional skirts for Scottish men. The caber is the symbol of the Highland Games.
Thousands of people gather each May for the "Cheung Chau Bun Festival" in Hong Kong. The festival honors a sea god, Pak Tai. There are parades and musical performances. The "bun snatching" competition is a race to the top of a 50-foot tower covered with buns. Contestants have three minutes to "snatch" as many buns as they can from the tower. They believe that the buns at the top will bring them the most luck.

Have you ever ridden a horse without a saddle? How far can you throw a giant log? Could you climb a tower made of buns? These are activities you'll see people do at festivals in different parts of the world.
"Naadam" is the biggest festival of the year in Mongolia. Each July, Mongolians in every town and city across the country celebrate Mongolian independence. The largest celebration is in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. Mongolians dress in colorful traditional costumes, and eat traditional foods, such as cold meat pancakes, called "khuurshuur." Naadam starts with a big parade that includes athletes, musicians, and people dressed as ancient warriors. Then, there are two days of traditional competitions: horse racing, archery, and wrestling. Bareback horse racing is the most popular sport. Children as young as six years old are jockeys. In the past, only men could compete during Naadam. Today, women and girls participate, too.
The "Highland Games," which began in the 1800s, take place in small towns throughout Scotland. From May to September, people gather to celebrate Scottish culture, while eating traditional foods such as haggis, Scotland's national dish. There are bagpipe and dancing contests, and athletic events. The caber toss is the most well-known athletic event. Kilt-wearing "tossers" throw cabers (tapered tree logs) into the air. The cabers are over nine feet tall and weigh 175 pounds. Each tosser gets three tries to throw the caber so that it turns end over end. It doesn't matter how far the caber is thrown.
On the island of Cheung Chau near Hong Kong, thousands of people gather each May for the "Cheung Chau Bun Festival." The festival commemorates the sea god Pak Tai. The buns, today marked with the word "peace," are offerings to Pak Tai. Festival highlights include parades, dragon and lion dances, and musical performances. At midnight on the third and final day, is the festival's "bun snatching" competition. Twelve specially-chosen contestants race to the top of a 50-foot-high (15 meters) tower covered with 9,000 buns. They have three minutes to collect as many buns as they can on the way to the top. The belief is that the buns at the top bring the most luck.

Do you close your eyes every night and sleep until morning? Or do you wake up in the middle of the night? Studies show that adults require 7-9 hours of sleep per night. But not everyone agrees that these hours need to be continuous.
For centuries, humans didn't sleep a solid eight hours a night. They slept for two short periods of time, with a break in between. We call this segmented sleep, or biphasic sleep.
People would get into bed a couple of hours after dusk and sleep for three to 3.5 hours. This was called "first sleep". Then, they'd wake up around midnight, stay up for one to two hours, and go back to sleep again. This "second sleep" lasted until dawn, when people would get up and start their day. During the break between sleep periods - called "the watch" - people relaxed, thought about their dreams, meditated, or did chores, such as sewing, or even chopping wood. Sleep psychologist Gregg Jacobs believes that relaxing during the watch could have been a natural way for the human body to handle stress.
Widespread use of artificial light changed human sleep. In 1667, Paris became the first city in the world to use streetlamps, allowing people to personalize their sleep schedules. Now that people could see at night, they could stay up as late as they wanted, regardless of when the sun set or rose. So segmented sleep began to disappear. By the late 19th century, with the advent of electric lights, most people in North America and Europe were sleeping through the night without waking up.
Some researchers believe that people with insomnia may just naturally prefer a segmented sleep schedule. In 1992, psychiatrist Thomas Wehr conducted a sleep study in which subjects lived in darkness for 14 hours a day for a month. These subjects naturally fell into a segmented sleep pattern.
Although segmented sleep was popular in the past, sleep specialist Dr. Timothy Connolly says, "Today, sleeping in shorter sessions is difficult, impractical, and can be destructive. "What do you think - could segmented sleep work for you?

Studies show that adults need 7-9 hours of sleep a night. But what if the hours aren't continuous? In the past, people naturally slept for two short periods of time, with a break in between. This is called segmented sleep.
For centuries, the human sleep pattern looked very different than it is today. People would get into bed a couple of hours after dusk for their "first sleep". Then, they would wake up at around midnight and stay awake for one to two hours. Finally, they would have a "second sleep" which lasted until they awoke at dawn.  During the break, called "the watch", people relaxed, read, meditated, or did chores. Sleep psychologist Gregg Jacobs believes that relaxing during the watch helped the human body manage stress naturally.
When towns started using street lamps, and indoor lighting methods improved, segmented sleep started becoming less common. By the late 19th century, with the invention of electric lights, most people were sleeping continuously through the night. They could get light whenever they wanted to. It no longer mattered when the sun set.
Today, people who think they have insomnia may just prefer a segmented sleep schedule. In 1992, psychiatrist Thomas Wehr conducted a study that showed how natural segmented sleep is. Subjects lived in darkness for 14 hours a day for a month. They naturally fell into a segmented sleep pattern.
Although segmented sleep was popular in the past, sleep specialist Dr. Timothy Connolly says, "Today, sleeping in shorter sessions is difficult... and can be destructive." What do you think - could segmented sleep work for you?

How Did You Sleep Last Night?
Health
Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night? You're awake for an hour or two. Then you go back to sleep. We call this segmented sleep.
In the past, everyone slept in two parts. Before there were electric lights, people went to sleep after dusk, when night began. They slept until about midnight, and were up for an hour or two. Then, they went back to bed, and slept until sunrise.
During this "break" people relaxed, or did chores, such as sewing or even chopping wood. Some experts think this break helped people have less stress.
By the end of the19th century, homes and streets had electric lights. So segmented sleep stopped being popular. People could turn on lamps and get light whenever they wanted. They didn't need to wait for the sun to rise or set.
Is segmented sleep good for people in today's world? Scientists aren't sure. What do you think?




Spice Up Your Health
Health
Spices can do more than make your food taste good. They can keep your body healthy.
Do you have stomach problems? Try eating a root from a ginger plant. It will make you feel less nauseous. Studies show that ginger can also keep people from getting ulcers. It can make headaches and muscle aches less painful, too.
Do you want to improve your memory? Smell some cinnamon! In one study, researchers gave people different things to smell. One thing was cinnamon. What were the results? Smelling cinnamon improved people's memory.  Cinnamon also lowers blood sugar in the body. So cinnamon is good for people with diabetes.
Do you like Indian food? Turmeric is a spice in many Indian foods. Turmeric has an important ingredient called curcumin. One study showed that curcumin helps people with heart disease. Another study showed that curcumin helps people with depression.

The next time you cook, use ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric. Do it for the taste, and do it for your health!

Spice Up Your Health

We all know that spices can make your food taste good. But did you know they can also help your body stay healthy? Researchers are finding that spices have many health benefits.
The ginger plant can be used in many ways. Some people use the plant's fresh root. Others use the root dried, as a powder. Still others take it in pill form. Studies have shown that ginger can help stomach problems, such as nausea. It also helps prevent certain types of ulcers. In one study, ginger powder capsules helped people with severe headache pain. Taking ginger can also help lessen muscle pain.
Cinnamon is another great spice. It comes from the bark of Cinnamomum trees. The trees' oil has a strong scent. In one study, researchers gave participants a few different scents, including cinnamon. Results showed that smelling cinnamon improved memory.  This could be helpful for older people with memory problems. Cinnamon also lowers blood sugar, so it's good for people with diabetes.
Turmeric is a yellow spice often used in Indian food. Turmeric contains the chemical curcumin. Curcumin has many health benefits. One study showed that taking curcumin before and after heart operations decreased patients' chances of having a heart attack. Another study showed that curcumin raises the level of certain hormones, helping to fight depression. Research also shows that curcumin stopped cancer cells from growing in animals. Scientists hope one day it will be used to prevent cancer in humans.

So the next time you cook, use ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric. Do it for the flavor and for your health!

We all know that spices can make your food taste good. But did you know they can also keep your body healthy? People all over the world have known about the health benefits of spices for centuries. But now, researchers are discovering additional health benefits.
People use the root from the ginger plant in many ways.  You can use the fresh root itself or dried as a powder. You can also take it in pill form. Studies have shown that ginger can help stomach problems. For example, ginger relieves nausea, and helps prevent certain types of ulcers. It also helps relieve pain. In one study, people who took capsules of ginger powder had relief from migraines. Ginger can also help reduce pain from aching, swollen muscles.
Another great spice is cinnamon. It comes from the bark of Cinnamomum trees, which have a special oil that gives cinnamon its strong flavor and scent. Cinnamon is sold in supermarkets as a powder, or in sticks. In one study, subjects were exposed to different scents. Researchers concluded from the study that smelling cinnamon helps the brain function better, and improves memory. This is promising for older people who have memory problems. Cinnamon also helps regulate blood sugar, which is good for people with diabetes. People who want to lose weight should sweeten their food with cinnamon - it has fewer calories than sugar.
If you eat Indian food, you've probably tasted turmeric. This bright yellow spice contains the chemical curcumin, which has many health benefits. One study showed that patients who took curcumin before and after heart surgery decreased their chances of having a heart attack. Another study showed that curcumin raises the level of certain hormones, helping to fight depression. In this study, curcumin had similar effects as anti-depressants. Research also shows that curcumin stops cancer cells from growing in animals, and may potentially prevent some types of cancer in humans.

So, the next time you cook, make sure to add ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric to your dish. You'll not only spice up your food, but you'll also spice up your health. 





People around the world often use adhesive bandages to protect cuts and scrapes while they heal. Adhesive bandages are strips of plastic, with a piece of gauze in the center, that stick to skin. These bandages haven't changed very much since they were invented around 100 years ago. But now, there may be a new generation of bandages.
A team of researchers at MIT, led by Xuanhe Zhao, created a "smart bandage." The new smart bandage is made of a transparent, stretchy material called hydrogel. The strong, sticky hydrogel bandage is very similar to human skin. It is 90% water, and can stretch to nearly twice its length. This makes it better than a traditional adhesive bandage for wounds because it can fit on almost any part of the body, including elbows and knees. Hydrogel bandages are flexible and can stick to wounds, even when elbows and knees are bent.
So, what makes this new type of bandage so "smart"? Inside each bandage are tiny electronics. "Electronics are usually hard and dry, but the human body is soft and wet," said Zhao. This means the soft, wet hydrogel bandages can make electronic monitoring more comfortable. Inside these bandages are temperature sensors, small tubes, and LED lights. When the sensors detect the body's temperature rising (due to fighting an infection), medicine is released directly into the wound. The LED lights flash when the medicine supply is low. In the future, the sensors could send information to smartphones through an app, helping doctors monitor patients. Patients could even monitor themselves!
For now, the research team believes the smart bandage will work especially well for burns. Burns can become infected easily and have to be monitored. Electronics in the hydrogel bandage placed on a burn will be able to monitor it closely, thus helping the wound heal faster. Zhao also thinks hydrogel bandages could be useful inside the human body. For example, hydrogels with sensors could be placed inside the body to help monitor sugar levels in people with diabetes. Zhao says the brain could even be an ideal location for smart bandages. He imagines bandages that could be specially designed to be like brain tissue. In the future, even our bandages will be "smart."

People around the world often use adhesive bandages to protect cuts and scrapes while they heal. They are strips of sticky plastic, with a piece of gauze in the center. Adhesive bandages haven't changed very much since they were invented around 100 years ago - until now.
 A team of researchers at MIT, led by Xuanhe Zhao, created a "smart bandage" made of hydrogel. Hydrogel is a clear, sticky material, very similar to human skin. It is 90% water, and can stretch to nearly twice its length. This makes it better than a traditional adhesive bandage for wounds because it can fit on almost any part of the body.
Inside each "smart bandage" are temperature sensors, lights, and medicine. The sensors can sense the body's temperature rising due to an infection. Then, the medicine is released directly into the wounds. The lights flash when the medicine needs to be refilled. In the future, the sensors could even send information to doctors' smartphones.
The research team believes that the smart bandage will work well for burns. Burns get infected easily and have to be monitored closely. Electronics are useful for monitoring burns. "Electronics are usually hard and dry," said Zhao, "but the human body is soft and wet." This means the electronics in the hydrogel bandage could be put over a burn and still be comfortable. Zhao thinks hydrogel bandages could also be used inside the human body. For example, hydrogels with sensors could be placed in the human body to help monitor sugar levels in people with diabetes. In the future, even our bandages will be "smart."

The adhesive bandage is over 100 years old. People all over the world put them on small wounds. Now, there is a new type of bandage. Scientists at MIT made a "smart bandage." They made it from hydrogel. Hydrogel is 90% water. The water keeps the bandage stretchy.
What makes this adhesive bandage "smart"? There are sensors and medicine inside the bandage. When a person has a fever, the sensor feels the body's temperature change. Then, the bandage delivers medicine to the wound. The bandage also has special lights. The lights flash when the bandage needs more medicine in it. In the future, the sensors will send information to doctors' smartphones.
Smart bandages can help people with different kinds of wounds - especially burns. Doctors need to check burns all the time. They need to make sure the burn is healing. Smart bandages are perfect for the job!




Listening to the Colors of Life
Health
Most people don't think about all the different colors they see. Neil Harbisson thinks about colors a lot. That's because the only colors he can see are black, white, and gray. Harbisson is color-blind.
Harbisson is an artist. Seeing color is important to him. So, he decided to use his ears to "see" color. Today, he "hears" color. How does he do it?
Doctors attached an antenna to Harbisson's head. The antenna has a camera. The camera takes pictures and changes them into sound. Harbisson can then hear these sounds. There is a special sound for each color. He can "hear" each one.
When he was young, Harbisson wore only black and white clothes. Today, he likes to wear colorful clothes. Why does he dress this way? "I used to dress in a way that looked good," Harbisson says. "Now I dress in a way that sounds good."

Listening to the Colors of Life
Health
For Neil Harbisson, the first part of his life looked like a black and white movie. He was born in 1982 with achromatopsia, a rare type of color blindness. He can only see the world in grayscale. Harbisson has never seen color, but now he can hear color. How does he do it?
 
Harbisson studied art and music when he was younger. All of his artwork was done in black, white, and gray. But Harbisson really wanted to see color. So, in 2003, a scientist named Adam Montandon created a device to help Harbisson "hear" color. The first device used a camera to send pictures to a computer. The computer made a different sound for each color. Harbisson "heard" the colors using headphones.
Over the years, Harbisson's device has improved. Today, he uses an antenna which was implanted into his head. He calls it his "eyeborg." When he looks at a color, a sensor on his eyeborg turns the color into a vibration. An implanted chip then transforms the vibration into a sound that Harbisson can hear.
Most humans are born with five senses: touch, sight, sound, smell, and taste. Harbisson says that for him, "color is this new sense" - not sight, not sound, but "an independent sense." Harbisson, who calls himself a cyborg, feels that the technology has actually merged with his brain, changing the way he hears and sees the world.
When he was younger, Harbisson liked to wear only black and white clothes. He says, "I used to dress in a way that looked good. Now I dress in a way that sounds good."

Have you ever seen an old movie filmed only in black and white? Well, the first part of Neil Harbisson's life looked just like that - a black and white movie. Harbisson was born in 1982 with achromatopsia, a rare type of color blindness. As a child, doctors discovered that he could only see things in grayscale - gray, black, and white. Although he has never seen color, Harbisson can now hear color. How does he do it?
When he was young, Harbisson studied art and music. All of his artwork was done in grayscale. But Harbisson really wanted to see color. In 2003, he started working with scientist Adam Montandon, who developed a device to help Harbisson perceive color. At first, Harbisson wore a webcam and headphones attached to a computer (in a backpack on his back). The webcam sent pictures to the computer, which translated the colors into sounds. Harbisson had to memorize the names of the colors and their unique sounds.
Over the years, Harbisson's device has improved. Today, he uses an antenna connected to a bone in the back of his head, and an implanted chip to hear colors. Harbisson calls his antenna an "eyeborg." When he looks at a color, a sensor on his eyeborg turns the color into a vibration on the chip. The chip's vibrations in his skull become sounds. Because the eyeborg is part of Harbisson's body, he wears it all the time, including when he sleeps - and takes a shower!
Most humans are born with five senses: touch, sight, sound, smell, and taste. Harbisson says that for him, "color is this new sense" - not sight, not sound, but "an independent sense." He can even hear types of light that others can't see, such as ultraviolet and infrared. Harbisson, who calls himself a cyborg, feels that the technology has actually merged with his brain, changing the way he hears and sees the world.
When he was younger, Harbisson had only black and white clothes. He says, "I used to dress in a way that looked good. Now I dress in a way that sounds good."




No Needles Needed

More than 380 million people around the world have diabetes, a disease that impairs a person's ability to control the level of glucose in his or her blood. Each and every day people with diabetes use a tiny needle to draw blood from their finger. This blood is then used to measure the amount of glucose they have in their body. People with diabetes have to do this many times a day. This unpleasant prick of a finger causes some people with diabetes to avoid checking their blood sugar, which can be dangerous. Scientists have been trying for years to find a less invasive way to measure blood sugar. And now, they might finally have found it - a temporary tattoo that can measure sugar levels in the body.

Amay Bandodkar, a graduate student in the Department of NanoEngineering at the University of California, San Diego, invented an easy-to-wear, temporary tattoo that can measure glucose levels. This breakthrough allows people with diabetes to monitor their levels without the finger prick test. A sensor is printed on special paper, and sticks to the skin like a rub-on tattoo. A tattoo lasts a day and only costs a few cents. It sends a mild, painless electrical current over the skin to measure sugar levels between skin cells, rather than the levels in blood. It is possible that this innovative device will be the first painless way to check glucose levels.

Early tests show that the tattoo senses a rise in glucose level just as accurately as the finger prick. However, it does not yet provide a numerical readout, which patients need to monitor their sugar levels. Researchers are currently working on a readout device which will provide a solution to this problem. The plan is to have a readout device that will send information directly to the patient's doctor, and store data online.

Scientists hope the same technology used in this temporary tattoo will someday be used to monitor levels of other substances in the human body. It might be used to test how well a medicine is working, or detect if you drank too much. Needles may soon be a thing of the past!

Millions of people have diabetes. People with diabetes have problems with their blood sugar. They need to check their blood sugar every day. To test their blood, they prick their finger with a needle. Many people with diabetes do not like to use the needles. Scientists are trying to find a way to check sugar levels without needles. Now, they might have an answer. Scientist Amay Bandodkar invented a special temporary tattoo. It can measure sugar levels without pricking your skin.

This special tattoo is like a sticker. It sticks to your skin. It lasts one day and only costs a few cents. The tattoo uses an electric current to measure sugar levels in the skin. The electric current is not painful.

Someday, there might be special tattoos that measure how well a medicine is working. There might be tattoos that tell you if you drank too much. In the future, we might not need needles at all!

Many people say technology is bad for our health. We spend hours in front of the computer instead of exercising. But this doesn't have to be true. We can use technology to get in shape, and stay healthy.
If you want to lose weight, take 11,000 to 13,000 steps a day. Fitbit will help. Fitbit is a device you wear. It keeps track of all the activity you do each day. It counts how many steps you take and how many stairs you climb. It makes people want to do more exercise.
Technology can make exercising more fun. In Dance Central, you compete in a dance contest. In Kinect Sports, you control the player in the game by moving your body. If you want the player to jump, you jump. It's like you're playing the sport.
Smartphone apps can also help you get in shape. Some apps keep track of how far you run or how fast you bike. Some tell you how to lift weights correctly.
Technology doesn't have to be an excuse to sit. It can be a reason to get up, get out, and get healthy!

Many people complain that technology is negatively affecting our health. We spend so many hours with our smartphones, computers, tablets, and video games, that we don't exercise. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can use technology to motivate us to exercise and help us get in shape.
Some video games give players a physical workout. Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is a video game based on a popular arcade game. In DDR, you follow the dance steps shown on the computer. Make the wrong moves, and you lose. Players are so busy trying to get the steps right they don't even notice they're getting a workout.
Another way to stay fit while playing video games is with Kinect Sports. Kinect is a motion sensor for the Xbox game system. You control players on the screen by moving your body. If you're boxing, you'll duck, and punch the air. If you're running a race, you'll really have to move those legs.
Smartphone apps can also help you stay in shape. There are many sports and exercise apps. Running apps track the distance you run, your speed, and the amount of energy you burn. They motivate you to beat your own scores.
There are other devices too, such as Fitbit. Put a Fitbit band around your arm and it'll track all the activity you do during the day. It'll count the number of steps you take and the number of stairs you climb. Fitbit even measures how well you sleep. FitBit's goal is to help you live a healthier life.
Computers, smartphones, and other technology shouldn't be excuses to sit. They should be reasons to get up, get out, and get healthy.

But it doesn't have to be that way. Technology can encourage us to exercise, help us get in shape, and make working out fun.
Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is a video game based on a famous arcade game. Although it's a game, it can also help you become more physically fit. In DDR, you follow the dance steps you see on the computer screen. You have to move quickly, and if you miss several steps, you lose the game. DDR has been so successful in motivating adults and children to exercise that some schools in the United States use DDR in physical education class.
Other video games make it possible for players to interact with images on a screen by moving their bodies. In Kinect Sports, for example, players move their arms and legs in activities such as boxing, tennis, skiing, and soccer. Research shows that these types of video games increase energy expenditure and improve fitness.
If you have a smartphone, there are many smartphone apps to help you get in shape. Running apps, for example, track the distance you run, your pace, and the number of calories you burn. They also store the information from each run, so you can check your progress.
Another type of device is Fitbit. Fitbit is an activity tracker. Put a Fitbit band around your arm and it'll track all the activity you do during the day. It'll count the number of steps you take as you walk and the number of stairs you climb. Fitbit measures how many calories you've burned. It even measures how well you sleep. The goal of Fitbit is to help you to live a healthier life.

When a car accident left Liz Soden paralyzed from the waist down, she tried not to let her disability keep her from doing the things she loved. But it was difficult. Once, during a family hiking trip, Liz's wheelchair kept getting stuck, so she told her husband, Brad, to take the kids and go on without her. But that was unacceptable to Brad. And he decided to build his wife a better wheelchair.
Brad Soden had no formal engineering training, and no college degree, yet he turned the garage into a workshop, and began to experiment. Two years later, Liz had her first working "Tankchair."
The Tankchair is an all-terrain wheelchair. With the treads and toughness of a tank, the Tankchair can ride up rugged hillsides, across sandy beaches, and through snow. Traveling up to 30 miles (48 km) an hour, the Tankchair can keep up with traffic on an average city road. The Tankchair also allows riders to stand, sit, or recline. This change of posture keeps their blood circulating, helping them to stay healthy.
Since his first model, Soden has been working non-stop to improve the Tankchair's performance and capabilities. Soden now runs a business designing, building, and selling Tankchairs. But they're not one-size-fits-all. Soden tailors each Tankchair to the client's needs and wants.
For Bill Weight, an injured Arizona police officer, Soden built a Tankchair resembling a police car. It even has flashing lights and sirens. For high-school student Joshua Brown, an avid drummer born with muscular dystrophy, Soden built a Tankchair that can be controlled by the foot. The chair also has detachable drums.
Through word-of-mouth alone, Soden's company has sold 200 Tankchairs to people around the world. And Soden enjoys delivering his chairs in person. He loves to see the looks on clients' faces when they receive his life-changing device.
Tankchairs are expensive to produce, and cost almost $20,000 to buy. But Soden - who sells Tankchairs to veterans at cost - isn't looking to get rich. His goal is to help people do what they enjoy doing, despite their disabilities. "You want to go fishing with your buddies? Go fishing," says Soden. "Get off the couch and go enjoy life!"

After Liz Soden was in a car accident, she could no longer walk. Activities she'd always loved to do became very hard. While hiking with her family, for example, her wheelchair kept getting stuck. So Liz's husband, Brad, decided to do something about it. He had no formal engineering training, and no college degree, but after two years, he had built Liz a "Tankchair."
The Tankchair is an all-terrain wheelchair. It's tough like a tank, able to ride over rocks, sand, and snow. It can travel up to 30 miles (48 km) an hour. The Tankchair is adjustable, so riders can sit, stand, or recline. This change of posture helps riders' blood circulate, to keep them healthy. Soden is constantly improving the Tankchair.
Brad Soden now has a business making and selling Tankchairs. And he tailors each Tankchair to fit the needs of its owner. Bill Weight, an injured Arizona police officer, has a Tankchair that looks like a police car. It even has flashing lights and sirens. High-school student Joshua Brown, an avid drummer with muscular dystrophy, has a Tankchair with detachable drums. Now he can play in his school marching band.
Soden's company has sold 200 Tankchairs to people around the world. Soden loves delivering the chairs personally. He likes seeing the smiles on customers' faces when they try their new vehicles.
Tankchairs are expensive to make, so they cost about $20,000 to buy. But Soden, who sells his Tankchairs to veterans at cost, isn't looking to get rich.

Liz Soden loved to hike. But after a car accident, she couldn't walk. So Liz's husband, Brad, invented the "Tankchair." It's a wheelchair that's tough, like a tank. It can drive on rocks and sand, in mud and snow. Liz can now go hiking.
After his first Tankchair, Brad Soden made more. He made them better each time. He also made them drive quickly. Tankchairs can travel up to 30 miles (48 km) an hour.
Today, Soden sells Tankchairs to people around the world. But Soden isn't doing it to get rich. In fact, when he sells Tankchairs to veterans, he sells them at cost.
Soden makes each Tankchair different, to fit each person. Bill Weight is an injured police officer. His Tankchair looks like a police car. It even has flashing lights and sirens. Joshua Brown is a high-school student who has muscular dystrophy. Brown's Tankchair has drums, so he can play in the school's marching band.

Bye-Bye Mosquito Bites
Health
No one likes mosquito bites. They're itchy and annoying. But in some places, such as Africa, mosquitos make people very sick. Many people even die. More than 60% of the people in Uganda have malaria. This is a sickness you can get from mosquitos.
But it's hard to find a product that stops mosquitos from biting. And some products that do work aren't safe to breathe in. But there may be hope, with Kite Patch.
Kite Patch is a small sticker. You put it on your clothes. When you wear Kite Patch, mosquitos can't find you! Mosquitos find people by smelling the carbon dioxide that they breathe out. But the ingredients inside Kite Patch trick the mosquitos. When you wear Kite Patch, the mosquitos can't smell the carbon dioxide. This makes you "invisible" to them! Each patch works for at least 24 hours. And the ingredients are safe to breathe in.
People are very excited about Kite Patch. And they're happy to help out. When the Kite Patch team needed money for testing, they asked for donations over the Internet. They asked for $75,000. But they received $557,254!
Now the team wants to go to Uganda to test Kite Patch, and see how well it works. This way, they can already start saving lives. Once Kite Patch works as well as it should, the team will sell it all over the world!

Bye-Bye Mosquito Bites
Health
There are many anti-mosquito products available, but many of them don't work or are dangerous to our health. In many countries, mosquitos mean itchy bites. But they eventually go away. However, in many areas, especially in African countries, a mosquito bite could mean life or death. In these countries, mosquitos bring about diseases that affect over 60% of the population. These diseases (malaria, West Nile virus, or dengue fever) can lead to death. But there may be hope - Kite Patch.
Kite Patch is a small sticker you put on your clothing. The sticker makes you invisible to mosquitos for at least 24 hours. Mosquitos find humans by smelling the carbon dioxide they breathe out of their mouths. The Kite Patch team developed a non-toxic formula - with ingredients used in food and fragrances - that prevents mosquitos from sensing humans.
 
People have supported Kite Patch from the very beginning. Last summer, the team needed to collect at least $75,000 in order to continue their research. Through crowd-funding site Indieogogo, they collected this amount within just four days. Through donations from 11,000 people, the team was able to collect a total of $557,254!
The next stage is to do a pilot run of the product in Uganda. This way, Kite Patch can already begin saving families, and the Kite Patch team can get it ready for sale all over the world. The exact price of the Kite Patch isn't yet decided. But the plan is to make the Kite Patch an affordable option for anyone in the world, anywhere in the world. Let's hope it's successful!

With all the anti-mosquito products available, we are still trying to find effective, safe ways to free ourselves from those pesky insects. In the developed world, it means itchy, unpleasant bites that eventually go away... until next season. But in many regions, particularly in African countries, a mosquito bite could mean life or death. Over 60% of the population has malaria or other life-threatening diseases brought about by mosquitos, such as West Nile virus or dengue fever. But hope seems to be around the corner, in the form of a 1.5 by 1.5 inch (3.8 by 3.8 cm) sticker. This is Kite Patch.
In order to repel mosquitos, we first need to understand what attracts them to humans in the first place. Mosquitos can smell the carbon dioxide we breathe out of our mouths. The Kite Patch team developed a non-toxic formula with ingredients used in food and fragrances. They tested the formula, and found that it actually makes humans invisible to mosquitos for at least 24 hours. Just stick the Kite Patch to your clothing and you're protected!
Kite Patch was developed by a team of scientists, designers, and public health experts, who have been working hard to find an effective, non-toxic way to repel mosquitos and therefore save lives. The research that led to this incredible technology came from the University of California (Riverside), with help from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.
Support for the Kite Patch has been strong since its early stages. In an effort last summer to raise money to continue with testing and product development, the target goal of $75,000 was met within four days! With the help of over 11,000 private funders (through crowd-funding site Indieogogo), a total of $557,254 was raised!
The next stage is to do a pilot run of the product in Uganda. This will begin the urgent work of saving families, while getting Kite Patch ready for production and distribution worldwide. Although the exact cost of the product isn't yet determined, Kite Patch will be an affordable option for anyone in the world, anywhere in the world. Let's hope it's successful!





Next to water, tea is the most popular beverage in the world, and has been for thousands of years. Whether it's a soothing cup of chamomile, a refreshing sip of green tea, or an invigorating mug of chai, research shows that these elixirs have many health benefits.

Tea was used in ancient times as a remedy for certain ailments. Today, researchers are also finding that tea can improve a person's health. Green and black teas, for example, are good for the heart and can help prevent certain diseases. These teas can also help with weight loss.

A collection of studies from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition provides convincing evidence of these benefits. According to Italian researcher Dr. Claudio Ferri, people who suffer from hypertension can greatly benefit from drinking black tea, as it reduces blood pressure, assisting the flow of blood through the arteries. According to Ferri, just one cup a day can reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack.

Green tea, a staple beverage in Japan, has gained world-wide popularity. Studies have shown that the antioxidants found in green tea may help prevent the growth of cancer in the bladder, breast, lung, stomach, and pancreas. Green tea lowers cholesterol, and may even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Milk has long been associated with strong, healthy bones. Now, researchers know that green tea can also help strengthen your bones, and minimize the risk of osteoporosis. Drinking green tea can reduce fractures in people over age 50, by 30%.

If you're looking to lose weight, green tea may help you with that, too. One study showed that people who drank green tea without otherwise changing their diets, lost 2.9 pounds (1.3 kilograms) within 12 weeks. The study also showed that tea drinkers in general have lower body mass indexes (BMIs) than people who don't regularly drink tea. In addition, researchers found that the natural components and antioxidants found in tea, together with the caffeine it contains, can burn up to 100 calories per day.

Now that you know of its benefits, it's time to develop a taste for tea - if you haven't already!

Green tea may also be a good way to lose weight. In one study, a group of people drank green tea for 12 weeks without changing what they ate. They lost up to 2.9 pounds (1.3 kilograms)!

So enjoy a warm cup of tea. You'll be doing something good for your body!





Cole Galloway is teaching people to drive. But they are not your usual drivers. They are between six-months and three-years old.
Galloway is a professor of physical therapy at the University of Delaware, in the U.S. He works with children who can't crawl or walk because they have disabilities. According to Galloway, it's very important for children in their early years to explore the world around them and connect with others. This is a problem for children who can't move around on their own.
So Galloway thought of a way to get immobile children moving. He teaches these children to drive special cars. Galloway buys electric toy cars that children can sit in and drive. Then he makes changes to the cars. He adds parts to the cars to make the cars safer. He also adds parts that give children with disabilities more control.
These cars are very successful. Parents say that their children are much happier now that they can move around on their own.
Galloway wants to get thousands of children around the world to move on their own during their early years. He wants parents to have to tell their child who can't crawl or walk to "come back here!" 
"I'm a creator of bad behavior!" says Galloway proudly.

Cole Galloway teaches children to drive. And they're only six-months- to three-years-old. A professor of physical therapy at the University of Delaware, Galloway provides mobility to children who can't crawl or walk because of physical conditions, such as cerebral palsy.
Galloway says it is very important for children to move around independently at the earliest stages of development. As babies crawl and walk, he explains, they explore and interact with their environment. Children who aren't mobile miss out on opportunities for cognitive development and socialization.
Galloway came up with a solution. He went to a toy store and purchased children's "ride-on cars." These are plastic toy cars with motors, for children to drive. They are decorated with popular children's characters, such as Lightning McQueen and Barbie. Galloway then modified the cars by adding different pieces of equipment to make them extra safe and to fit the needs of each child driver.
The cars cost about $200 apiece. They are relatively light, and very colorful. With these cars, children with mobility issues can "run around" with other kids on the playground, rather than just watch from the side. "Two- and three-year-olds shouldn't be sitting passively," says Galloway. "They should be causing havoc."
The young drivers test-drive cars on tracks in Galloway's lab as he continues to develop and improve the cars. Galloway also plans on introducing computerization into the low-tech cars, by adding such features as sensors and a GPS.
Galloway's goal is to get thousands of children worldwide to move independently during their critical years of development. He wants parents of immobile children to have to start yelling, "come back here!"
"I'm a creator of bad behavior!" says Galloway proudly.

Cole Galloway is a driving instructor, but not the kind you'd expect. His students are between the ages of six months and three years. A professor of physical therapy at the University of Delaware, Galloway is providing mobility to children who can't crawl or walk due to intellectual disabilities, or physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy.
"We know that movement and mobility drives developmental change in the first three years," says Galloway, also an infant behavior expert. He explains that as babies crawl and walk, they explore and interact with their environment. Children who aren't mobile miss out on these opportunities for cognitive development and socialization.
To solve the problem, Galloway first developed a robotic wheelchair that even a six-month-old can control. (The average electric wheelchair is available for children ages three and up.) But the robotic chair is very big, heavy, and expensive. And there aren't enough of them. So Galloway went back to the drawing board and came up with a new, low-tech solution.
Galloway went to a toy store and purchased "ride-on cars." These are child-sized plastic motorized cars for children to drive, decorated with popular children's characters, such as Lightning McQueen and Barbie. Galloway then modified the cars by adding extra pieces of equipment for safety and to meet the physical needs of each child driver.
The modified cars cost less than $200. They're lightweight, and easy to move and control. And the colorful characters adorning the cars encourage other children to approach the driver.
 
With their cars, children with mobility issues can "run around" with other children in the playground, instead of just sitting and watching from the sidelines. "Two- and three-year-olds shouldn't be sitting passively," says Galloway. "They should be causing havoc."
Galloway's lab has indoor and outdoor tracks, where children test out cars as Galloway continues developing them. Eventually, he plans to introduce computerization into the low-tech cars. They'll have sensors, for example, and a GPS.
Galloway's goal is to get thousands of children worldwide moving independently during their critical years of development. He wants them to "get into the action" at home and in their daycare centers. He wants parents to yell, "Come back here right now!' to their previously immobile children. "I'm a creator of bad behavior!" says Galloway proudly.




Dance Your Way to Fitness
Health
If you want to get in shape but you aren't motivated to work out, a unique form of aerobics, called Zumba, may be the perfect workout for you! Zumba mixes aerobic exercise with dancing, for a fun, energizing experience. It was invented by accident, by a Columbian aerobics instructor named Beto Perez. Having forgotten to bring his dance music to class one day, he put on some of his own Latin music and told people to move to the beat. The students loved it. The class was hugely popular, and from then on it was dubbed "Rumbacize."
In 1999, Perez moved to the US, where two entrepreneurs, Alberto Perlman and Alberto Aghion, approached him about setting up a business. They made a deal and began selling the renamed "Zumba" program all over the world.
In a typical Zumba class, instructors take their students through a series of moves from such dance styles as meringue, reggaeton and salsa. A  Zumba toning class may also include some exercises, such as knee lifts and squats. There are no verbal instructions in class; students learn by copying what the teacher is doing. The music is mostly Latin, but also includes other diverse styles, such as calypso and swing.
Complex dance moves aside, Zumba is not about precision. It's about having fun. People are free to follow the teacher precisely or imprecisely, or to do their own thing if they like. The Zumba slogan, "Ditch the workout, join the party!" says a lot about its philosophy; Zumba should be fun. It shouldn't feel like exercise.
Zumba has spread all over the world like wildfire. Currently, it is practiced by 12 million people at 110,000 sites, in 125 countries around the world. Millions of Latin DVDs have also been sold, and there is even a line of clothing called "Zumbawear," which is very popular.
Not only is Zumba fun and entertaining, it is also extremely effective as a form of exercise. In 2012, the American Council on Exercise conducted a study to examine its health benefits. They found that Zumba is indeed a full body workout, and it's also good for strength and flexibility. They also discovered that one Zumba class burns an average of 369 calories, which is more than cardio kickboxing, step aerobics, or power yoga.
So, whether you're looking to burn calories, strengthen muscles, or just have fun, go and find yourself a Zumba class!

In 2012, the American Council on Exercise studied Zumba's health benefits. It found that Zumba is a full body workout, and is also good for strengthening and flexibility. One Zumba class alone burns an average of 369 calories. This is more than cardio kickboxing, step aerobics, or power yoga.
So whether you want to burn calories, strengthen muscles or just have fun, go Zumba!

If you want to get in shape, but don't like to exercise, try Zumba! Zumba is a mix of aerobics and dancing. Columbian aerobics teacher Beto Perez started it. One day, he forgot to bring his dance music to class. He played Latin music instead, and told his students to dance. They loved it. Perez called his new exercise-dance class "Rumbacize."
In 1999, Perez moved to the United States. He found two business partners. Together, they opened Rumbacize classes all over the world. But they changed the name to "Zumba."
Zumba music is mostly Latin. Instructors teach meringue, reggaeton and salsa dancing. They don't tell the students what to do. They just do the moves and the students copy them.  In Zumba, you don't have to do everything exactly right. The Zumba slogan is "Ditch the workout, join the party!" Zumba focuses on fun, not exercise. Twelve million people, at 110,000 different places, in 125 countries, do Zumba. People also buy Latin music DVDs and Zumba clothing.
A 2012 study found that Zumba tones the body. It also builds strong, flexible muscles. One Zumba class burns about 369 calories. That's more than step aerobics or power yoga. So, if you want to get in shape by having fun, Zumba is for you!

"Bibliotherapy" is a way to help solve people's problems using reading. Studies show that the method is very successful. It works best along with therapy. Bibliotherapy can help people with problems such as depression and anxiety, or eating disorders. It can also help children in schools learn to deal with things that are difficult, such as divorce.

The ancient Greeks thought reading was good for one's health. Later, the Romans did, too. In the early 1800s, European doctors gave patients books to help them with their problems. In the US, during World War II, doctors treated soldiers and patients in mental hospitals with bibliotherapy. Teachers used it in schools from the 1940s.

It's important to find the right reading material for the patient. This can be a book or even an article. Sometimes, the therapist will recommend a book about a patient's disorder. Other times, the therapist will give the patient a book about other people who have the same disorder. This helps patients feel they are not alone. At school, students read alone or aloud. Then the teacher does activities that connect to what the students read.

More and more people are learning that reading can heal.

Books just might be the answer to some of our emotional problems. A therapy, known as bibliotherapy, uses reading to help people deal with difficult issues. Studies show that the method is effective, especially when used with traditional therapy, such as counseling and medication. Bibliotherapy is used to treat various problems and disorders, such as anxiety and depression, agoraphobia, alcoholism, and eating disorders. It's also used in schools, to help children cope with problems such as divorce, or to educate them about people with disabilities.

The Ancient Greeks, and later the Romans, saw a connection between health and reading. In early nineteenth century Europe, doctors recommended books for people with emotional problems, and most mental hospitals had libraries. Bibliotherapy was used after World War II in the United States, to treat soldiers and psychiatric patients. Teachers started using bibliotherapy in schools in the 1940s.

In a therapy context, reading is usually done outside of therapy sessions. During sessions, therapists will discuss with patients what they read. In the classroom, teacher and students may read together or students may read alone. Reading is often accompanied by other activities.

The most important aspect of bibliotherapy is matching the book to the patient. The book assigned will vary depending on the patient and situation. Some books help educate patients about their issues. Other books may help them accept the treatment prescribed for them. Others may introduce patients to people who've had similar difficulties, and help them to gain insight into their own problems and ways to deal with them.

In the classroom, teachers assign books, portions of books, or even comics. Teacher and students may read together or the students may read alone. Reading is often followed-up with activities.

For people who like to read, bibliotherapy is the perfect therapy - healing while doing something they love. For people who aren't big readers, bibliotherapy may reveal the healing power of books.

The books you read for pleasure may also be the answer to your sorrows, according to supporters of a therapy called "bibliotherapy". Bibliotherapy uses reading - of books, articles, and other materials - to help people deal with their problems. Many studies show that the method is successful, especially when used alongside traditional forms of therapy, such as counseling and medication. Bibliotherapy is used to treat various problems and disorders, including anxiety and depression, agoraphobia, eating disorders, and alcoholism. It's also used in schools, to help children cope with divorce, for example, or to educate them about people with disabilities.

Bibliotherapy has a long history. In Ancient Greece, people considered the library to be the healing place of the soul. Later, the Romans also saw a connection between health and reading. By the early 19th century, doctors in Europe were recommending books for people with emotional problems, and most mental institutions had libraries. Bibliotherapy was used extensively in the U.S. after World War II, to treat both soldiers and psychiatric patients. Teachers began using bibliotherapy in the classroom in the 1940s.

In a therapy context, reading is usually done outside of therapy sessions. During sessions, therapists will have discussions with patients about what they read. In the classroom, teacher and students may read together or students may read alone. Reading is often accompanied by other activities.

The types of books or other materials used in bibliotherapy vary greatly depending on the patient and his or her situation. One patient suffering from an eating disorder may be assigned a book about body image, while another will be assigned an article on the negative effects of eating disorders on the body. Some materials may teach patients about their problems, or try to help them understand the treatment they are undergoing. Other materials may introduce patients to people with similar difficulties. This helps them feel they are not alone, and see how others cope.

In the classroom, teachers may assign books, portions of books, and even comics. Teacher and students may read together or students may read alone. This reading is often followed-up with related activities.

For people who already like to read, bibliotherapy is ideal - they heal while doing something they love. For those who aren't big readers, bibliotherapy will reveal the healing power of reading.




Don't Diet, Turn Off the News!
Health
Watching the news can make you gain weight, and not just because you're sitting on the couch. Recent studies have shown that watching or reading upsetting news, especially about the economy, can cause you to eat more. It can activate your survival instincts, making you crave calories.
One study was conducted by the University of Miami. Researchers divided subjects into four groups. Each subject was given a bowl of chocolate candies, of which they could eat as much as they wanted. Researchers told two of the groups that the chocolates were high in calories. They told the other two groups that the chocolates were low in calories. (In actuality, the chocolates were all the same.)
As the subjects ate the chocolates, they also read a set of posters hanging on the wall. One set displayed sentences containing "harsh" words, such as "struggle" and "adversity." The other set displayed sentences containing "neutral" words. Each group was presented with either the "harsh-word" or "neutral-word" posters. 
What were the results? The high-calorie/harsh-words group ate 25% more chocolate than the high-calorie/neutral-words group. Yet, the low-calorie/harsh-words group ate 27% less chocolate than the low-calorie/neutral-words group, and 73% less than the high-calorie/harsh-words group. (The two neutral groups ate the same amount.)
Researchers explain that harsh words or news makes the body perceive that it's in danger. The body thinks it's lacking resources, especially if the bad news relates to money. When the body perceives danger, its survival instincts are triggered. The brain tells the body to eat lots of high-calorie foods, as resources, in order to survive. High-calorie foods keep the body satisfied longer than low-calorie foods.
And so, when subjects in the study read the harsh sentences, their bodies craved high-calorie food. That's why those who thought they were eating high-calorie chocolate ate lots of it. (They ate more chocolate than any other group.) On the other hand, those who thought they were eating low-calorie chocolate didn't each so much. (They ate less than any other group.) That's because their bodies craved high-calorie, not low-calorie, food.
Based on these findings, it seems clear that if you want to avoid gaining weight, cut back on the amount of news you read or watch. Or at least, hide those high-calorie snacks!

Did you know that watching the news can make you gain weight? According to studies, hearing bad news makes you overeat. It also makes you crave high-calorie foods.
One study was conducted by the University of Miami. Researchers divided subjects into four groups. Each subject was given a bowl of chocolate candies. They could eat as much as they wanted. Researchers told two of the groups that the chocolate was high in calories. They told the other two groups that the chocolate was low in calories. (The chocolates were actually all the same.)
As the subjects ate the chocolates, they also read signs on the wall. The signs had sentences written on them. In both the "high-calorie" and "low-calorie" groups, half the people read signs with sentences containing harsh words, such as "struggle" and "adversity." The other half read signs with sentences that had neutral words.
What were the results? The high-calorie "harsh-words" group ate 25% more chocolate than the high-calorie "neutral-words" group. Yet, the low-calorie harsh-words group ate 27% less chocolate than the low-calorie neutral-words group. (Both neutral-word groups ate the same amount.)
Researchers explain that harsh news makes the body feel as if it's in danger. When the body's in danger, the brain tells it to eat lots of high-calorie foods, to survive. High-calorie foods keep the body satisfied longer than low-calorie foods.
When subjects in the study read the harsh sentences, their bodies craved lots of high-calorie food. So, when they thought they were eating high-calorie chocolate, they ate lots of it. In fact, they ate more than any other group. Yet, when subjects who read the same harsh sentences thought they were eating low-calorie chocolate, they didn't each so much of it. This is because their bodies wanted high-calorie food, not low-calorie food. 
The results show that harsh, unpleasant news can make you eat more. It seems clear, therefore, that if you want to avoid gaining weight, put down the newspaper, or turn off the TV news!

Did you know that bad news can make you gain weight? Studies show that bad news makes you eat more. It also makes you want food with lots of calories.
The University of Miami did a study. They put people into four groups. Each person got a bowl of chocolate candies. They could eat as much chocolate as they wanted. Researchers told two groups that the chocolate was high in calories. They told the other two groups that it was low in calories. (The candies were really all the same.)
As the people ate their chocolates, they read signs on the wall. In the "high-calorie" group, half the group read signs with words that make people worry. The other half read signs with neutral words. The same thing happened in the "low-calorie" group.
What were the results? The high-calorie "worry group" ate more chocolate than all the other groups. And the low-calorie worry group ate less than all the other groups.
Researchers explain. When things worry us, such as bad news, our bodies feel like they're in danger. When the body is in danger, it eats more, to survive. And it eats high-calorie foods; high-calorie foods make the body feel full longer than low-calorie foods.
That's why the worry group that thought the chocolate was high in calories, ate lots of chocolate. And the worry group that thought the chocolate was low in calories, didn't eat so much. Their bodies wanted high-calorie food, not low-calorie food.
But too many calories make us gain weight. So, if you don't want to gain weight, turn off the TV news. Or hide the high-calorie food!




Allergy Apps
Health
Do you have a food allergy? Is it hard to figure out which foods you can eat? Now, there are smartphone apps to help you.

Examples of these apps are "Can I Eat It" and 'FoodWiz". All you need is a smartphone and the camera in the phone.

First, you type into the app what you're allergic to. Then, with the camera, you scan the barcode of a food you want to buy. After you scan the barcode, the app will tell you if you can or cannot eat the food. 

Let's say you want to buy cookies, but you can't eat peanuts. You take a box of cookies off the store shelf. Then you scan the bar code on the box.  If the cookies have peanuts, the app will tell you not to eat them.

The "Can I Eat It" app shows a thumbs-up on your phone if the food is safe for you to eat. The app can also speak, and tell you if the food is okay. This is good for people who can't see well.  "Can I Eat It" can also tell the user if a certain food is safe for pregnant women, if it is low in fat, kosher, or halal.

The "FoodWiz" app is mostly helpful for people with serious food allergies and celiac disease. This free app can find about 40 different kinds of allergens. The "FoodWiz" database has information on more than 80,000 different foods made in the UK.

"Can I Eat It" and "FoodWiz" are quick and easy to use. But you can only use them for foods that have barcodes. Also, these apps are not 100% accurate. If you do need an answer that is 100% correct, then you need the "iTube." 

The iTube weighs less than two ounces. You connect it to your smartphone. It doesn't read a barcode; it tests the actual food. You take a small piece of the food you want to eat, and mix it with different chemicals. Then you put the mixture in a small container that is part of the iTube. In about 20 minutes, the iTube will let you know if you can eat the food or not.

How can these kinds of apps help you in your life?

Allergy Apps
Health
Grocery shopping can be very difficult for people with food allergies. It can also be difficult for people with celiac disease--who can't eat gluten, or people with diabetes--who can't have sugar. Fortunately, there are smartphone applications to make it easier for people today to buy food.

Apps like "Can I Eat It" and "FoodWiz" use a barcode system. The system uses your cell phone's camera to scan the barcode of the food you are wondering about. Within a few seconds, it will tell you whether or not the food is safe for you to eat. In both apps, you must create a dietary profile, which tells the system what kinds of foods you can or can't eat. And if one family member is allergic to one type of food, and another family member to another type of food, you can create separate profiles.
 
The "Can I Eat It" app shows a thumbs-up on your phone if the food is safe for you to eat. The app also has a voiceover setting, for people who can't see well. "Can I Eat It" can also tell you whether or not a food is safe to eat during pregnancy, low in fat, kosher or halal, etc.

"FoodWiz" was made by a British company called Food Angel. The app can be downloaded free of charge. This app is mostly helpful for people with celiac disease or serious food allergies. It can search for about 40 different types of allergens. The "FoodWiz" database has information on more than 80,000 products made in the UK, and it is always growing.
 
"Can I Eat It" and "FoodWiz" are quick and easy to use, but can only check packaged foods. In addition, their results aren't 100% accurate.  So If you're extremely allergic to something, and can't have even a tiny amount of the allergen, these apps might not be accurate enough. The solution?  The iTube.  The iTube weighs less than two ounces and attaches to your smartphone. You have to grind up a small amount of the food you want to test, put it in the container attached to the iTube and then mix it with different chemicals. It takes about 20 minutes to get a response, but the results are as accurate as a laboratory test.

How do you think this kind technology could help you in your life?

Health
Do you have a food allergy, and find yourself staring at a box of cookies, struggling to read the fine print for the offending ingredient?  People with severe food allergies, celiac disease (can't tolerate gluten), or diabetics, who require a low-sugar diet, often find grocery shopping cumbersome and time-consuming.  Fortunately, technology has come to the rescue! There are now smartphone applications designed to make it easier for people to make sensible and safe food choices.

Apps like "Can I Eat It" and "FoodWiz" use a barcode system. They simply use your smartphone's camera to scan the barcode of the product in question. Within seconds, the app tells you whether or not the food is suitable for your diet. Both apps require you to create a dietary profile. If one family member is allergic to peanuts and another is on a low-carb diet, you can create separate profiles within the same account.
 
The "Can I Eat It" app was developed in the UK with the help of famous food and drink journalist, Martin Isark. Once a product is scanned, a thumbs-up or thumbs-down displays on the screen, based on the preferences you set in your profile. The program also offers detailed information on each product that is included in the database. People who can't see well can benefit from the app's voiceover setting. "Can I Eat It" serves as a general tool for all kinds of preferences, such as whether or not a food is low-fat, safe to eat while pregnant, kosher, or halal.

"FoodWiz", produced by a British company called Food Angel, mostly caters to those with severe food allergies and celiac disease. The app can be downloaded free of charge and can search for approximately 40 different types of allergens. The "FoodWiz" database contains over 80,000 products produced in the UK, and is constantly being updated.

The above mentioned apps are quick, fun, and easy to use, yet they only apply to packaged foods and don't provide the precision and accuracy that some people truly require. The solution? The iTube. Weighing in at less than two ounces, the iTube plugs into your smartphone. It actually requires a little chemistry on your part-- you analyze a small sample of the food by grinding it up and mixing it with various chemicals. But the accuracy of the results is equivalent to laboratory testing. While the results aren't instantaneous, you can expect to get a response within 20 minutes. The iTube lets you know if a food has even a trace of allergen, something that a barcode won't be able to tell you.

These smartphone applications have certainly proven to be a breakthrough in medical technology. How do you think this kind technology could help you in your life?




The Barefoot Hiker
Health
Imagine hiking through forests, meadows, and streams. Now picture doing this in your bare feet! Millions of people a year do just that. In Europe there are hundreds of barefoot parks (also called barefoot trails or barefoot walks). Barefoot parks are especially popular in Germany and Austria. These parks are open to the public and afford visitors the opportunity to kick off their shoes and walk through nature barefoot.
These barefoot hikers sink their feet into soil, leaves, sand, and clay. They tread on moss, bark, pebbles, leaves, wood, and tree roots. Some paths are even made of glass! But the glass pieces are smooth and rounded, so they are safe to walk on.
The shoeless visitors balance on tree logs and tight ropes, wade through mud, and walk through rivers. Many barefoot parks even have playgrounds especially designed for the naked foot, with moving bridges, zip-lines and swinging ropes.
Some people go to barefoot parks to feel more connected to nature. Others just want to experience new sensations and feel interesting textures as they explore the outdoors.
If there are no barefoot parks in your area, then keep an eye out for barefoot hiking clubs, whose members walk along regular nature trails without shoes.
Proponents of barefoot hiking say that hikers have more stability walking on uneven terrain while barefoot, and that when wearing hiking boots, people are more likely to twist their ankles. They believe that walking barefoot is easier on the joints and causes less damage to the knees, hips, and back. In Germany, barefoot hikers claim that walking in bare feet can strengthen the body's immune system. But not everyone recommends shoeless walking. Podiatric surgeon, Dr. David Samuel, mentions such hazards as puncture wounds and foot infections.
Beginners may find barefoot hiking challenging, whether in a barefoot park or on a regular trail. But they generally get used to it quickly. There are also recommended tips to follow, like focusing your eyes a few paces ahead as you walk, and keeping your weight on the balls of your feet, instead of on your heels. If this sounds fun to you, then take off your shoes, and step into nature!

Indigenous Architecture
General Interest
In the past, explorers from Europe traveled all over the world. Many came to North America. The explorers met the people in the area. These indigenous people had their own traditions. They had buildings. They hunted and fished. Some had boats called canoes. But the explorers tried to change the indigenous people. They wanted them to live like Europeans.
Hundreds of years passed. Today, indigenous people want to keep their traditions. One way is with indigenous architecture. With indigenous architecture, you make special buildings. Some look like indigenous buildings from the past. Some show indigenous traditions. The architects are usually indigenous people.
Seneca College in Toronto, Canada, has a student center. The center is an example of indigenous architecture. The building looks like a big canoe. Indigenous students meet and have events there.
In Alberta, Canada, there is a famous cliff. Indigenous people hunted there for 6,000 years. There is a visitor center. It looks like part of the cliff. Visitors learn about indigenous people's history.
For indigenous people today, these buildings say, "Welcome home!"

Indigenous Architecture
General Interest
When European explorers arrived in Canada in 1534, they met the Iroquoians. The Iroquoians were the indigenous people who had been in the area for thousands of years. Iroquoians lived in longhouses, fished from canoes and had their own culture. But the Europeans tried to make the indigenous people live like Europeans. This happened again and again all over the world - from North America to Fiji to Australia. However, indigenous people didn't give up their culture completely.
A new style of architecture - indigenous architecture - helps keep indigenous culture alive. The architects are usually indigenous people, and they design buildings that sometimes show the indigenous way of life, and the strong connection to the land. Sometimes these buildings look similar to traditional indigenous buildings and sometimes, these buildings look modern. But they make indigenous people feel safe and comfortable.
Seneca College in Toronto, Canada, used indigenous architects to design its student center. The center is called Odeyto, meaning "good journey." From the outside, the building looks like a canoe pulling up to a dock. Inside is a large area where indigenous students meet and have cultural events.
In Alberta, Canada, there is a cliff where indigenous people hunted buffalo for 6,000 years. The site is called Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. A visitor center, designed with indigenous architecture, was built right into the cliff. This makes it look like it's part of the cliff. The center has seven levels. The top levels lead to a trail and views of the area. The five lower levels show the indigenous people's history.
Buildings designed using indigenous architecture send a message to indigenous people: You are welcome here.

These indigenous people, who had been in the area for thousands of years, lived in longhouses, fished from canoes, and had their own unique culture. The Europeans didn't respect the indigenous culture. Wherever Europeans met indigenous peoples - from North America to Fiji to Australia - they forced their own way of life onto them. However, these indigenous peoples didn't give up their culture completely.
Today, indigenous people still try to keep their culture alive. One way they do this is through indigenous architecture, which involves creating buildings that reflect indigenous culture. This can mean recreating the architectural style of traditional buildings, or producing designs that are symbolic of the indigenous way of life and strong connection to the land. The architects themselves are usually members of indigenous communities. They design buildings that make indigenous people feel safe and comfortable, often using traditional materials such as stone and wood. Although the final result may be a modern-looking building, indigenous visitors enjoy feeling "at home."
Seneca College in Toronto, Canada, hired two indigenous architecture firms, Gow Hastings and Two Row Architect, to design its student center. The center is called Odeyto, meaning "good journey." The building's curved design looks like a canoe pulling up to a dock. This represents the students' stop at the college on their life's journey. In addition to a work area, there is a lounge where indigenous students gather to celebrate and hold ceremonies. Ashley George, an indigenous student at Seneca College, enthusiastically remarked, "This place welcomes you and becomes a home away from home."
In Alberta, Canada, there is a seven-level visitor center at an old hunting site. The site, used for 6,000 years by indigenous hunters to chase buffalo over a cliff, is called Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. The center, built right into the cliff, is part of the landscape - reflecting the indigenous idea of respect for the land. The top two levels lead to a trail and views of the area. The other five levels tell the detailed story of the indigenous people's history.
Buildings designed using indigenous architecture send an important message to indigenous people: We value your culture. You are welcome here.

Have you ever watched tired parents trying to keep their children entertained in an airport waiting area? Have you ever traveled with your own kids and wished there was something fun for them to do during the endless wait for a flight? Finally, help is here! Many airports have created kid-friendly spaces to keep children happy and busy.
Singapore's Changi Airport is one of the most kid-friendly airports in the world because of its many attractions. In addition to four indoor playgrounds, children can enjoy the Chandelier, a huge red structure built using 10 kilometers of rope, which has climbing nets, and poles to slide down. There are also multiple gardens to explore, including a butterfly garden with over 1,000 tropical butterflies flying among flowers, plants, and bushes. According to a popular travel Web site, Family Globetrotters, "There are so many things to do in Changi Airport with the kids, you'd want to delay your connecting flight!"
Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC, USA, worked with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to create a unique, indoor play space called the FunWay. As they enter the space, kids are welcomed by a statue of Orville the Squirrel, named after Orville Wright, one of the Wright brothers. Young travelers can stretch their legs by running around on tires and models of luggage. They can also climb up a kid-sized airport control tower and use a slide to come back down. Kids can also "zoom" on two futuristic jets, or read information on the FunWay walls to learn interesting facts about airplanes and aviation.
Other airports around the world also have activities to keep children occupied. At Munich Airport, in Germany, there is a park with a playground, miniature golf, and old aircraft. At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, USA, children can visit Kids on the Fly, an interactive play space with a working luggage scale and hundreds of blocks for building. Even airports without special children's play spaces may offer behind-the-scenes tours of the airport - and that's fun for the whole family!

Yes Lady Finance is a loan company in Hong Kong. This company takes designer handbags as collateral! The borrower must pay back the loan in four months. Then, they get their bag back. What other kinds of creative collateral can you think of?

Creative Collateral
General Interest
Have you ever taken a loan? To borrow money from a bank, you need collateral. Collateral is something you own that you agree to give to the bank if you don't return the money. Collateral is often something like a house or car. But some banks and loan companies take more creative kinds of collateral.
The Credito Emiliano bank in Italy accepts Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese as collateral. Parmigiano-Reggiano is made only in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Farmers must age the cheese for 18 to 36 months. The longer it ages, the more valuable it becomes. So, when Parmigiano-Reggiano farmers need money - for tractors or animals, for example - they use their cheese as collateral. Currently, the bank keeps more than 300,000 wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano in a special warehouse.
Many fine wines also get more valuable with age; some bottles are worth up to $10,000! Wine collector Nick Gangas wanted to open a restaurant. He used bottles of his finest French wines as collateral for a $150,000 loan. "By the time they're ready to drink," he says, "I'll have paid back the loan."
The loan company Yes Lady Finance also accepts creative collateral. They accept designer handbags! The head of the Hong Kong company, Byron Yiu, explains that people feel attached to their bags. "They don't want to sell them for good, but they need money." Clients have four months to repay the loan. One handbag was so valuable that the client received a $32,000 loan!
People have used many other types of interesting collateral too, such as horses and a winning lottery ticket. What types of creative collateral might you have?

Creative Collateral
General Interest
Have you ever applied for a loan? Getting a loan requires collateral - something you own, like a home or vehicle - that you agree to give to the bank or loan company if you don't repay the money. However, some financial institutions accept more creative types of collateral.
Since 1953, the Italian bank Credito Emiliano has been accepting an interesting type of collateral - Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Parmigiano-Reggiano, known as "the king of cheeses", is produced only in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. It is made in a very specific way, following strict guidelines, and aged for 18 to 36 months, becoming more valuable (and delicious) the longer it ages. When Parmigiano-Reggiano farmers need to borrow money - for tractors or livestock, for example - the bank accepts giant wheels of the expensive cheese as collateral. The bank stores the cheese in a special warehouse that currently holds more than 300,000 wheels, worth over 180 million dollars.
Did you know that there are bottles of wine worth more than $10,000? Wine collectors often use wine as collateral, sometimes using the loan money to buy more wine! Like Parmigiano-Reggiano, many fine wines increase in value with age. Wine collector Nick Gangas used bottles of his finest French wine to secure a loan for around $150,000 to open a restaurant in Illinois, USA. "By the time they're ready to drink," he says about his collateral, "I'll have paid back the loan."
Not all interesting collateral is edible or drinkable. Designer handbags, such as those by Gucci and Chanel, are accepted as collateral by Yes Lady Finance, a loan company in Hong Kong. The company's chairman, Byron Yiu, believes that people have sentimental attachments to their bags. "They don't want to sell them for good, but they need money. So, we came up with the idea of running a financial company that lets people use their handbags to borrow money. It turns out to be a very popular service." Clients have four months to repay loans with interest. One designer handbag netted a $32,000 loan!
People have used other types of unusual collateral too, such as horses, and a winning lottery ticket! What do you own that can become creative collateral?





The year was 1789. The French Revolution had begun, and the royal family � King Louis XVI, his queen, Marie Antoinette, and their two children � were arrested. Things got worse for the royal family when they were put in prison in the Temple in Marais. Marie Antoinette believed she was going to be sent into exile, so she hid some of her magnificent and expensive jewelry in a wooden box and managed to smuggle it out of France. The exquisite pieces were sent to her nephew, the emperor of Austria, from whom she hoped to retrieve them one day. Unfortunately for Marie Antoinette, history and the people of France had other plans for her. She and her husband were executed in 1793. Years later, however, her daughter was released from prison, and she became the new owner of the jewels.
The historic pieces of jewelry stayed in the family and were passed down through the generations. For over 200 years they weren't seen in public by anyone. Then, in 2018, the famous international auction house, Sotheby's, announced that ten pieces of Marie Antoinette's jewelry would be sold at auction. The news created a sensation. Marie Antoinette was known for her passion for fashion � especially jewelry. According to Sotheby's Daniela Mascetti, "No other queen is more famous for her love of jewels, and her personal treasures, pearls, and diamonds." And now, her famous jewels were to be sold!
In order to create excitement for the sale, Marie Antoinette's jewels were sent on a trip around the world. Visitors came to view the jewelry of France's last queen in cities such as London, New York, Hong Kong, and Geneva. And people didn't just look at the jewelry. They were also allowed to touch it, and even try it on!
As for the auction, Sotheby's achieved a rare "white glove" sale, which means that all of the items were sold successfully. Among the collection was a heavy diamond and pearl pendant. Pearls were extremely rare in the 18th century, and worth more than diamonds! Before the sale, the pendant was valued at between $1-2 million, but it sold for $36 million � a record for a sale of royal jewels.

In 2018, there was an exciting jewelry auction. Many years ago, the jewelry belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette of France.
Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were king and queen of France until the French Revolution in 1789. In 1792, people in the French government put them and their children in prison. Marie Antoinette had a lot of beautiful, expensive jewelry. She didn't want anyone to take it. So, she hid her jewelry in a box. The queen sent the box to her family in Austria. Sadly, people in France killed Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette the next year.
And what happened to the jewelry?
Marie Antoinette's daughter didn't die in prison. When she got out, she went to Austria and got the jewelry. It stayed in the family for many generations. For over 200 years, only people in the family saw the queen's jewelry - until the auction.
People bought every piece of jewelry that was at the auction. One person paid $36 million for just one piece of the famous jewelry!




Welcome to Twins Days!

Do you know any twins? Twins are two people born together from the same mother. Each year there's a Twins Days Festival in Ohio, USA. It's the largest festival for twins in the world!
Twins from all over the world come to the festival every August. The celebration starts with a parade. Twins wear matching costumes. They walk down the street, together with musicians and floats. There are other exciting activities, too. People run in a 5K race. They can also dance or sing in a talent contest.
The Twins Days Festival has a different theme every year. One year the theme was "games". People wore costumes from video games and board games. Some twins chose costumes from Angry Birds and Mario Brothers. At the end, people with the best costumes won prizes.
There were only thirty-six pairs of twins at the first Twins Days Festival in 1976. But the festival grew. At a recent festival, there were around two thousand pairs of twins!

"Do you need a pair of shoes?" a young man asks someone who is homeless. The young man is Rikki Mendias. He runs an organization called HavASole.
HavASole is a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles, California, USA. They give new or gently-used sneakers to homeless people across the country. Sneakers are comfortable, rubber-soled shoes, often worn when playing sports or exercising.
Walking is the main mode of transportation for those living on the streets, which means lots of wear and tear on their feet. Studies show that many homeless people suffer from foot problems, including calluses and infections. HavASole distributes high quality footwear that's also cool and trendy, so people can protect their feet while feeling proud about what they're wearing.
Rikki Mendias started HavASole in 2014. As a child, he and his mother spent six years living in a homeless shelter. Money was scarce, and Mendias's mother couldn't always afford the necessities. One day, a former resident came back to visit the shelter. Noticing that the young Mendias's shoes were full of holes, she took him to a shoe store and bought him two new pairs of sneakers. "I liked the smell of the new shoes," he remembers. Wearing those sneakers also gave him confidence. "That was the moment I decided that I wanted to have new shoes on my feet no matter what the circumstance." As an adult, Mendias became a fashion photographer, and a "sneaker head" (someone who collects high-end sneakers) - with more than 150 pairs! Then one day, he thought about those people who couldn't afford even one new pair. "What if I gave my shoes back to those in need?" Mendias asked himself - and HavASole was born. 
Today, HavASole receives thousands of donations from individuals, shoe stores, and professional sports teams all over the USA. So far, the organization has given away over 12,000 pairs of sneakers in 20 cities. But HavASole doesn't decide who gets which shoes; they let recipients choose their own pairs.
What Mendias enjoys most about his work is the connections he makes with the people he meets. "It's a lot of love," he says. "It's something you can't purchase."

Thank you, HavASole!





Today, people buy many items in packages. They often choose the items because they like the colors of the packages. Companies want a lot of people to buy their products. So they have experts choose colors for their packages. These experts are called corporate colorists.
Corporate colorists know which colors are popular. They also know how colors make people feel. For example, yellow makes people feel happy. Green makes people feel a product is healthful and natural. A white bottle makes people feel the product inside is clean. That's why many companies use white bottles for their soaps. Blue makes people feel calm. So, blue is a good color for health or medical products.
It's very important for companies to choose the best colors. The Coca-Cola Company uses red for its famous drink label. Red makes people feel excited and hungry.
So, how does the color of your favorite product make you feel?

The packaging on supermarket shelves is full of colors. Each color was carefully chosen to attract shoppers. The people who help companies choose colors for their products are called corporate colorists.
Corporate colorists help companies choose colors based on many things. For example, how does the brain react to certain colors? What associations do people have with that color? How does the color make people feel? Experts say yellow makes people feel happy. Green packaging usually makes people think the product inside is healthy and natural. White makes people feel clean and pure. This is why companies may choose to use white bottles for their soaps. Blue (the most popular color) makes people feel relaxed and calm. This is why corporate colorists may suggest using blue for health or medical products.
Using the right color is very important for a company's success. When Apple Inc. made their iMac computer in five bright colors named after fruits, sales skyrocketed. The Coca-Cola Company uses red for its famous drink label. The company chose red because it makes people feel excited and hungry.
For corporate colorists, the Pantone company is the world's "color authority". Each year, Pantone chooses a Color of the Year based on color trends. For 2018, Pantone chose a shade of purple called Ultra Violet. Ultra violet makes people feel hopeful about the future. Pantone says the color "lights the way to what is yet to come."

Walk into a supermarket, and you'll find almost every color you can imagine. These colors were chosen very carefully by the companies who make the products on the shelves. The granola bars' green box is meant to attract consumers seeking a healthy, natural snack. The white bottle of hand soap gives you the feeling that it's clean and pure, making it more likely you'll buy it. The people who help companies create color schemes for their products are called corporate colorists.
Corporate colorists became relevant with the invention of synthetic color in England in 1856. This gave companies more choices for their products than ever before. Suddenly, clothing could be made in a variety of colors, instead of just beige or black. Soon, color experts were printing color guides to help companies choose which colors would go well with their products.
Today, in addition to forecasting new trends, corporate colorists advise companies on which color scheme suits their products. Experts rely on many factors, including which emotions certain colors evoke in the consumer. For example, yellow makes people feel happy, while orange makes them feel a product is "friendly." Blue (the most popular color) is considered a relaxing, calming color and also relates to trust and reliability. Corporate colorists may recommend this color for health or medical products.
Graphic designer Courtney Garvin explains experts' approach to choosing a product's colors: "There's the physical aspect - what happens optically, what happens in the brain. Then you have cultural associations, personal connotations, and on and on."
Using the right colors can be integral to a product's success. For example, soon after introducing the iMac computer in bright colors named strawberry, blueberry, tangerine, grape and lime, Apple Inc. reported a huge increase in profits. Another successful product, Coca-Cola, uses red for its famous drink label because red is linked to feelings of hunger and excitement.
For the world's corporate colorists, the Pantone company is the global authority on color. Each year, Pantone chooses a Color of the Year based on color trends. For 2018, Pantone picked a futuristic shade of purple called Ultra Violet which they believe "lights the way to what is yet to come."




Stephen Hawking, World-Famous Physicist
General Interest
Stephen Hawking was a British physicist, a theoretical physicist, like Albert Einstein. Theoretical physicists use math and observation to figure out how nature works. Like Einstein, Hawking was world famous. His book, A Brief History of Time, about space, time, and black holes, was an international best seller, selling more than 10 million copies. One reason it was so popular was that it explained scientific concepts in a way that the average person could understand.
Hawking received a bachelor's degree in physics in 1962, at age 20, and began his graduate research in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. The following year, Hawking was diagnosed  with ALS, a disease that affects the brain and the ability to control the muscles. The doctors didn't expect him to live longer than a few years. But Hawking continued his scientific work, and in 1965, he earned  his PhD. He went on to live another 53 years.
As ALS weakened his muscles, Hawking became confined to a wheelchair. Eventually, he also lost his ability to speak. To communicate, Hawking began using a special computer system in which he would choose letters or words from a computer screen, and a speech synthesizer would speak the words for him. The voice from the synthesizer is the robotic-sounding voice most people associate with Stephen Hawking today.
Although Hawking's body continued to deteriorate, his mind remained active and focused on his work. He began exploring questions like, "Where did the universe come from, and where is it going?" Over the course of his career, Hawking received many honorary degrees, and prestigious awards and prizes for his scientific research. Hawking wrote, or co-wrote, a total of 15 books. His writings made theories in physics interesting and understandable to everyone.
Hawking passed away in 2018, at the age of 76. The date was March 14, Albert Einstein's birthday. Despite his physical challenges in life, Hawking made great strides in his field, and inspired many people. In an interview back in 2011, Hawking told a reporter, "I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first."

ALS is a disease that affects the brain, and makes it difficult for a person to control his or her muscles. Most people with ALS live only a few years after being diagnosed. But this did not deter Hawking. He earned a PhD in 1965, continued his scientific work, and lived another 53 years. Unfortunately, on March 14th, 2018, Hawking died at the age of 76.
ALS made Hawking's muscles progressively weaker. Hawking had to use a wheelchair to get around. Eventually, he also lost the ability to speak. To communicate, Hawking began using a special computer system. Hawking chose letters or words from a computer screen, and a synthesizer would speak the words for him. The voice from the synthesizer sounded like a robot.
Although the ALS continued to harm his body, Hawking's mind never stopped working. He wanted to explore how the universe began. He wrote many books that helped people who weren't scientists understand complicated theories in physics. Hawking rose to the top of his field, and inspired many people. In an interview in 2011, he said, "I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first."

There is a bus stop in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, USA. Near the bus stop, there is a small playground. But it's not just any playground. It's a place for children to learn as they play.
The playground is called an "Urban Thinkscape". An Urban Thinkscape has activities that help children with math, speaking and other skills. Large puzzles help the children learn math. There are also pictures for the children to look at. The children use these pictures to tell stories. This helps them with their speaking skills. The playground has rubber mats, too. Children jump on these mats. They have to jump in special patterns. This helps the children learn to concentrate. When children get better at math, speaking, and concentrating, they do better in school.
The team that built the Urban Thinkscape wants to build many more playgrounds. What other fun activities do you think they can add?

In the USA, psychologist Brenna Hassinger-Das and a team of psychologists, educators and architects turned an empty lot behind a bus stop into an "Urban Thinkscape". It's a small playground where children play - and learn!
Research shows that children from lower-income families hear 30 million fewer words by age three than children from higher-income families. This means that children from lower-income families may struggle with language skills once they begin kindergarten. Children only spend 20% of their day in school. So Hassinger-Das' team designed the Urban Thinkscape to give these children more learning opportunities, outside of school. It's built in a public space where children and caregivers spend time. Talking and playing together allows children to learn more language and develop other skills.
The first Urban Thinkscape has already opened. It's in a low-income neighborhood in Philadelphia, USA. There used to be an empty lot with a sidewalk, behind a bus stop. Now there are different stations where children can develop skills such as math, language, and concentration. In one station, children can jump and hop in a pattern on rubber mats. Pictures in another area inspire children to tell their own story. On the back wall of a bus stop, children can solve puzzles. Children search for hidden images in a large, blue metal sculpture. There is also a special streetlamp - it projects pictures onto the ground. These activities also encourage caregivers and children to talk about what they are seeing and doing. This improves language skills.
Hassinger-Das and her team hope to build Urban Thinkscape in more neighborhoods. Programs like Urban Thinkscapes give children a helpful start to success in school!

Each year, children in the USA begin school - but not all begin on an equal footing. An educational study revealed that children from lower-income families have heard 30 million fewer words by age three than children from higher-income families. This puts them at a disadvantage, affecting their later success in school. An organization called Urban Thinkscape is trying to close this educational gap by turning empty lots into playspaces called "Urban Thinkscapes".
The first Urban Thinkscape has been built on a corner of a low-income neighborhood in Philadelphia, USA. It includes different stations, each of which helps develop a different skill. One station has rubber mats where children jump and hop in a pattern. This helps build their concentration skills. Another station, intended to build literary skills, is a wooden deck where pictures inspire children to invent their own stories. On the back wall of a bus stop, children work to solve puzzles, to help them develop math skills. In a blue metal sculpture, children search for hidden images of food, animals, and other objects. This strengthens their problem-solving skills. Finally, there is a streetlamp where children turn a handle to make pictures move on the pavement below. This sparks their curiosity. All these activities also encourage interaction between the children and their caregivers.
Urban Thinkscape is run by a team of psychologists, educators, and architects. Lead psychologist Brenna Hassinger-Das says "There are differences in kids' skill levels before they even start formal schooling in kindergarten." Hassinger-Das and her team are building Urban Thinkscape along paths where children walk when they aren't in school, which is 80% of their day! Urban Thinkscape create the opportunity for children and caretakers to maximize this time - talking, playing, and learning together.
 
There are organizations similar to Urban Thinkscape all over the world. The Pop-Up Adventure Play company turns empty lots in the United Kingdom, Columbia, and Uganda into temporary playgrounds, using recycled materials. Anthill Creations, based in India, has a similar mission.
In the future, Hassinger-Das and her team hope to create Urban Thinkscape in more locations. The team also hopes to include these playspaces in establishments such as supermarkets and laundromats. Projects like Urban Thinkscapes are on the path to providing educational success for all.





People all around the world love eating chocolate. But did you know that when chocolate was first brought to Europe from Mexico in the 1500s, it was a dark, bitter drink? The Maya used beans from cocoa trees to make the chocolate drink more than 12 centuries ago. The Aztecs valued chocolate so highly that they used its beans as money. (For the Aztecs, money literally grew on trees!) Historians believe that Spanish explorers brought the drink back to Europe, where honey and sugar were added to the liquid to give it sweetness. The drink grew in popularity, and chocolate cafes opened up in all the great cities of Europe.
The creation of the first solid chocolate in Holland in 1847 was followed by the invention of milk chocolate in 1875. More than 50 years passed before white chocolate was created. From that time on, chocolate lovers had three choices of chocolate to lick off their fingertips - dark, milk or white. That is, until September 5, 2017, when a new chocolate was introduced to the world. Say hello to ruby chocolate - it's pink!

Ruby chocolate is the first new natural color for chocolate since white chocolate appeared 80 years ago. The deep pink color is all natural, with nothing added. Its flavor is natural, too. The taste has been described as "berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness". Ruby chocolate was developed by Barry Callebaut, the largest chocolate producing company in the world.  Exactly how they make it is a secret, and you won't find a list of ingredients anywhere, but it took the company 13 years to perfect the pink treat. The chocolate is made from cocoa beans that grow in Brazil, Ecuador, and the Ivory Coast. Through years of research and development, the company discovered a way to process those beans to keep their pink color and special flavor.

Does it sound intriguing? Would you like to try some ruby chocolate? Chocolate companies all around the world hope so. In the last few years, chocolate sales worldwide have been slowing down. Some people believe that ruby chocolate could bring new life to the chocolate market. So think pink, and have some berry delicious chocolate!

People all over the world love chocolate. But did you know it has been around for centuries? Historians believe that Spanish explorers brought a bitter, dark chocolate drink from Mexico to Europe in the 1500s. The drink, which was made from cocoa beans, seemed strange to Europeans. However, after they added honey and sugar to make it sweet, chocolate quickly became very popular. Suddenly, all the big cities in Europe had chocolate caf�s.
In 1847, the first solid chocolate was created in Holland. Then, in 1875, milk chocolate was invented. More than 50 years later, white chocolate followed. For almost 80 years, there have been only three types of chocolate - dark, milk and white. But in September, 2017, the world met an exciting, new type of chocolate. Say hello to ruby chocolate - it's pink!
Ruby chocolate is the first new chocolate variety since white chocolate. The deep pink color and berry flavor are all natural. Barry Callebaut, the largest chocolate producing company in the world, developed ruby chocolate. It took the company 13 years to get this pink treat ready for chocolate lovers. They used special cocoa beans that grow in Brazil, Ecuador, and the Ivory Coast. The company discovered a way to process those beans, while still keeping their pink color and special flavor. But exactly how they make it is a secret - you won't find a list of ingredients anywhere!

People who have tasted ruby chocolate describe its "berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness". So think pink, and get ready for some delicious, pink chocolate!

When Brian was a puppy, he lived in prison. Brian was part of a program in the US called Puppies Behind Bars (PBB). In PBB, prisoners train puppies to be service dogs. The dogs help veterans who have anxieties and fears.

Each prisoner in the program gets a puppy to train. The prisoner trains his or her dog for one to two years. The dogs learn to do about 90 tasks. The dogs open doors and turn on lights. They learn to wake up a veteran when he or she is having a bad dream. They even salute!

Gloria Stoga started Puppies Behind Bars. She wanted to help veterans with fears live normal lives. She also wanted to give prisoners a chance to help others.

The prisoners are sad when the dogs leave. But they also feel good. "It fills us with pride," says Nora Moran, who trained dogs when she was in prison. And Joey, who was Brian's trainer, says, "It's so gratifying knowing that I did something for somebody..."

Brian was sent to prison, but he didn't do anything wrong. Brian is a dog! He was sent to prison as part of a program called Puppies Behind Bars (PBB). In the program, US prisoners train puppies to become service dogs for US veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The prisoners in PBB are called puppy raisers. Each puppy raiser is given an eight-week-old Labrador retriever puppy. The puppy lives in the cell with the prisoner and goes wherever he or she goes. The puppy raisers train their dogs for one to two years. The dogs learn to follow over 90 commands. These include opening doors, turning on lights, waking veterans up when they're having nightmares, and even saluting!

Gloria Gilbert Stoga started Puppies Behind Bars. She wanted to help make it easier for veterans with PTSD to get back to their everyday lives. She also wanted to give prisoners a second chance, by helping others. Nora Moran was a prisoner. She decided she wanted to bring good to the world, so she became a puppy raiser. Today, Moran is out of prison; she works for PBB.

When dog training is finished, the prisoners teach the veterans how to work with the dogs. The prisoners and the veterans respect one another and feel connected.

The day the dogs leave prison to go live with their veterans is bittersweet. The prisoners are sad to see the dogs go. But they also feel a sense of pride. Joey, the puppy raiser who trained Brian, says, "It's so gratifying knowing that I did something for somebody while I'm here, something noble."

Brian was in prison for two years, but he hadn't committed a crime. Brian is a dog! He was sent to prison as part of a program called Puppies Behind Bars (PBB). In the program, inmates in US prisons train puppies to become service dogs for US veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Each prisoner in the program is paired with an eight-week-old Labrador retriever puppy. The puppy lives in the cell with the prisoner and goes wherever he or she goes.

The prisoners, called puppy raisers, train their dogs for one to two years. The dogs learn to follow over 90 commands so they'll be able to assist their veterans. Commands include everything from opening doors and turning on lights, to waking veterans when they're having bad dreams, and dialing 911, the phone number for emergency services. The dogs even learn to salute!

Gloria Gilbert Stoga is the founder of Puppies Behind Bars. She wanted to help veterans with psychological injuries transition back to civilian life. She also wanted to give prisoners a second chance, a chance to prove they can do something right by helping others. Nora Moran is a former prisoner who used to be a puppy raiser. She says that after being sent to prison, she realized she didn't want to be a person who caused damage in the world. "I wanted to be a person who was a vehicle for healing and growth." Today, Moran is out of prison, and working for PBB.

After the prisoners train the dogs, they teach the commands to the veterans. There is a strong connection between the inmates and the vets. "They are both in their own prisons," says Stoga. The veterans, who are afraid to go out into the world, are "imprisoned" in their own homes. The dogs bring prisoners and veterans out of their isolation, and help them build emotional connections.

The moment when the dogs are given over to the veterans is bittersweet. It's hard for the prisoners to say goodbye, but they feel proud of their puppies and themselves. As Joey, Brian's puppy raiser, says, "It's so gratifying knowing that I did something for somebody while I'm here, something noble."




Fidget Toys
General Interest
Do you fidget? Do your hands always need to be busy doing something, especially while listening to a lecture or sitting in a meeting? If so, you are not alone. In fact, fidgeting, once frowned upon, is becoming more understood and accepted in society. It has even become a trend!

Among the bestselling gadgets on the market today are fidget toys -- mindless, handheld gadgets that you fiddle with. The fidget spinner, a three-pronged disc that you spin between your thumb and forefinger, is extremely popular. Millions of people, from elementary school children to adults, are using them.

Another popular fidget toy is Fidget Cube. It is a small cube that has something different to fidget with on each side, such as buttons, a rolling ball, or a switch. The company, Antsy Labs, went on Kickstarter to try to raise $15,000 to produce Fidget Cube. They succeeded in raising close to $6.5 million!

The spinner, Fidget Cube, and other fidget toys claim to help people focus -- even people with ADD and ADHD. But is there any truth to this claim? Some research suggests that if a task is not interesting enough to keep our focus, then doing a mindless, sensory-motor activity at the same time can help us focus. John Ratey, associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, explains that fidgeting can work like ADD and ADHD medications by increasing levels of dopamine, a chemical that helps with focus and attention.
Are these research findings an endorsement for fidget toys? Not necessarily. It depends on who's using the toys and how. There are correct and incorrect ways to fidget. Helpful fidgeting requires an object that takes no concentration, and one that you don't need to look at when you use it, so you can focus on the main task. Also, everyone is different. A fidget method that works for one person might not work for another.

What's certain is that you don't have to run out and buy a spinner (which can cost anywhere from four dollars to a few hundred dollars!) or a cube. Just pick up a rubber band, some paper clips, or a set of keys -- some of the original fidget toys!

Do you fidget? Are your hands always playing with something? If so, you're not alone. Lots of people fidget. Now it's even a trend!

One of the top-selling items right now is fidget toys. These are small gadgets you can fiddle with. One is a fidget spinner. It's a flat, round object with three prongs. You hold it between two fingers and spin it. Another is the Fidget Cube. It's a block with six sides. Each side has something different to fidget with, like buttons to push or a ball to roll.

Companies that make fidget toys say they can help people concentrate -- even people with ADD and ADHD. But is this true?

Some research shows that fidgeting (though not necessarily fidget toys) can help people with ADD and ADHD. If an activity they're doing doesn't keep their attention, then doing a mindless activity at the same time may help them concentrate. John Ratey, a professor at Harvard Medical School, says that fidgeting can work like ADD and ADHD medications. It can increase levels of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps with focus and attention.

So, are fidget toys effective? It depends. A fidget toy is helpful when it doesn't distract you or others. It's helpful if you can use it without looking at it and without thinking about it, so you can concentrate on the main task.

But there's actually no need to buy a fidget toy. You can fidget with objects around the house or office. Keys, rubber bands, and paper clips are some of the original fidget toys!

Fidget toy companies say their gadgets help people concentrate. They even help people with ADD. But is this true? John Ratey is a professor at Harvard Medical School. He says fidgeting can help people with ADD concentrate. But can fidget toys help? Some can, but not all. A good fidget toy is mindless. You don't have to think about it when you use it. You also don't have to look at it.

People who want a fidget toy don't have to buy one. Rubber bands and house keys are fidget toys, too!




The Wonderful World of Fonts

Look in a newspaper. Look online. How many fonts do you see? Lots of them. But we didn't always have so many fonts. At first, there was one.

Before the 15th century, scribes wrote books by hand. This took a very long time. So, Johannes Gutenberg made a printing press. It was a machine that printed books. The machine used small metal blocks. On each block was a letter. Gutenberg put the letters together in different ways to print papers and books. Gutenberg made the letters look like the letters of the scribes. This type was "Blackletter". But Blackletter was hard to read. So someone invented Roman Type. It was much easier to read. As time went on, other printers created other fonts. In the early 19th century, many people used posters to make announcements. Printers created bigger fonts, so people could read the posters from far away.

Today, we have computers. Computers have lots of fonts. A new, and fun font is Futuracha. As you type, the letters change shape. Who knew fonts could be fun?

Almost everywhere we look, we see different styles of fonts. We see them online, on billboards and street signs, in newspapers, magazines, and in printed ads. But we didn't always have so many fonts.

At first, scribes wrote books by hand. Writing by hand was expensive and took a lot of time. But as more people began to read, more books needed to be written. This led to the invention of the printing press, by Johannes Gutenberg, in the 15th century. Gutenberg made blocks with letters on them. These blocks were arranged in different orders to write different texts. The letters on the blocks looked like the fancy handwriting of the scribes. This typeface, called Blackletter, had thick lines. Blackletter looked nice in handwritten texts, but it was hard to read when printed. Eventually, a new style of lettering, called Roman Type was created. It was much easier to read.

Over time, more fonts developed. In the early 19th century, posters became very popular. Larger fonts were created so people could read the posters from far away.

The invention of personal computers led to an even wider range of fonts. Today, the number of fonts available on word processers and the Web is constantly growing. Many people are creating their own fonts.

A team in Athens called "holy" created a popular new font called Futuracha. It automatically adjusts as you type. While you write a word, a letter you typed earlier might change in style, so that the whole text fits nicely on the page. Futuracha is just one example of how typography has become an art.

We are surrounded by all sorts of fonts in our day-to-day lives. There are over 1,000 different styles of letters online, in ads and billboards, on street signs and in good-old-fashioned newspapers and magazines. But this wasn't always the case.

Before we had printed books, scribes wrote books by hand. Writing by hand was incredibly time-consuming and expensive. As more people began to read, there was an increased demand for written works. This sparked the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg, in the 15th century. Gutenberg made blocks with individual letters, which were rearranged in different ways to write different texts. Gutenberg modeled these letters after the handwriting of the scribes. This typeface, called Blackletter, had thick elaborate lines. But while this was a good style for handwritten texts, it was hard to read when printed. This led to the development of Roman Type, which was much simpler and easier to read. As time went on, more fonts were developed, including italics, which enabled more letters to fit on a page.

With the spread of advertising came the need for different font types suitable for billboards, posters, and newspapers. In the early 19th century, posters became one of the main forms of announcements to the general public. Larger fonts were developed so the posters could be read from a distance.

Fast forward to the advent of personal computers. They changed the game of typeface forever. Though computer font began with a very pixelated style, technology quickly evolved. Today, the number of fonts available on word processers and the Web is constantly growing. Many artists and other individuals are creating their own fonts.

One font that's trending now is called Futuracha. It's a whimsical font with the unique feature of automatically adapting and adjusting as you type. While you write a new word, a letter you typed earlier might change in style, so that the whole text fits nicely on the page.  The product, called Futuracha Pro, was created by a team in Athens, called "holy".

Futuracha is just one example of how typography has developed into an art form of its own.




EMILY - The Robot Lifeguard
General Interest
In bodies of water around the world, lifeguards rescue around 1 million people, annually. What if even more lives could be saved? EMILY might make that possible. EMILY is a robotic lifeguard that rescues swimmers in danger, all across the globe.
EMILY is a device that saves people from drowning. It speeds through water at 35 kph with the help of a battery, motor, and jet pump. EMILY is a cylinder, a little over one meter long. It has a Kevlar-reinforced hull, and the top is covered in strong, brightly-colored, waterproof canvas - so it can be easily seen in the water. Lifeguards send EMILY into the water, and swimmers in distress grab onto the handles. EMILY's handles help swimmers stay afloat until a rescue team can reach them. Exterior lights enable rescue teams to see during night rescues.
EMILY can be dropped into the water from above, such as from a helicopter, or launched from a boat or from the beach. Rescuers use a remote control to guide EMILY through the water. EMILY's camera sends video to smartphones via an app - helping rescuers locate swimmers in danger in the water. A two-way radio helps rescuers communicate with the people in danger.
In 2001, EMILY's inventor, CEO Anthony Mulligan, and his company Hydronalix started working with the US Navy, developing a machine to locate whales in the ocean. Mulligan's original technology evolved into EMILY. Each EMILY costs $10,000 dollars. EMILY is being used by countries around the world, including Indonesia, Brazil and France.

While human lifeguards swim at an average of 3kph, EMILY can reach a swimmer more than six times as fast, increasing the swimmer's chance for survival. EMILY can also save more than one person at a time - eight people can hold onto EMILY's handles.
EMILY is an acronym (short for Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard). The name honors Emily Shane, Mulligan's daughter's best friend who died in 2010. Mulligan remembers Shane as a person who always wanted to help people. "She always put other people in front of herself," says Mulligan "and that's really what this robot is about."

Some people don't have a home. Many people without homes sleep outside, or in shelters. A city in Canada called Medicine Hat is trying to solve this problem. How? They are giving homes to people who need them. The city calls their program "Housing First."
There are many different reasons for being homeless. Before Housing First, people without homes had to deal with these reasons first. Then Medicine Hat city officials gave them housing. Housing First does the opposite. Now, social workers give people a place to live first. When people have their own place to live, it helps them feel safe and secure. Then, they can work on their problems.
In the past, the city spent thousands of dollars helping people without homes. With Housing First, the city now spends much less money. The mayor of Medicine Hat, Ted Clugston, believes his city is on the right track. Medicine Hat may be the first city in Canada where everyone has a home!

Homelessness is a worldwide problem. In Canada, over 200,000 people become homeless each year. One city, Medicine Hat, Canada, has an innovative solution to this problem - "Housing First."  
In the past, many people who were homeless in Medicine Hat were on the streets during the day. At night, they sometimes slept outside or in shelters. They often ended up in the city's jails and emergency rooms. Homelessness was costing the city thousands of dollars. Medicine Hat wanted to find a better solution.
Programs often want people who are homeless to solve their problems first. Then, the programs would help find them a place to live. But Housing First does the opposite. Before, "we would say to somebody...you better try to straighten your life out  , and then we'll talk to you [about getting a home]," says Medicine Hat mayor, Ted Clugston. Instead, Housing First gives people without homes housing - first. Once they feel safe and settled, social workers help them deal with the reasons why they became homeless.
In 2009, the city started building new housing for the program. Since then, almost 900 people have moved off the streets. Housing First costs the city $20,000 per person - much less than they spent before the program started.
Medicine Hat may soon be the first Canadian city to end homelessness. By giving people a safe place to live, Housing First helps improve their lives. "Finally, a place to call home," says a woman helped by Housing First.

Being homeless affects people all over the world. In Canada, over 200,000 people become homeless each year. One city, Medicine Hat, Canada, is solving this problem in a creative way with a program called "Housing First."  
Medicine Hat is a small city, with 60,000 people. Yet it has the same issue of homelessness as larger cities. In the past, some people who were homeless in Medicine Hat would wander the streets during the day, and stay outside or in shelters at night. If they trespassed on people's property, they were often taken to jail. If they became sick, an ambulance would take them to the emergency room. Dealing with these issues was costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars, so the city of Medicine Hat looked for a better solution.
The common approach to dealing with homelessness is to have people without homes solve their personal problems first, and only afterwards, find them homes. But Housing First takes the opposite approach. "In the old days," says Medicine Hat mayor, Ted Clugston, "we would say to somebody...you better try to straighten your life out, and then we'll talk to you [about getting a home]." However, in the Housing First program, people who are homeless are given housing - first. Then, once they feel safe and settled, social workers help them deal with the underlying reasons for their homelessness, and help them find jobs.
Since 2009, when the city started building new housing for the program, nearly 900 people have moved off the streets. Housing First costs the city $20,000 per person, instead of five times that amount for a person living on the streets. The city aims to find people housing within 10 days. "I was shocked how they got me a place fast," says Donald Smith, who was homeless before getting help from Housing First.
By providing people with homes, Housing First gives them security and helps them get back on their feet. "Finally, a place to call home," says a woman helped by Housing First. With its revolutionary program, Medicine Hat is on its way to becoming the first community to end homelessness.




Picture Books - Not Just for Kids!
Education
When Mary Zdrojewski, a school librarian in New York, USA, asked a group of students how they wanted to spend their library time, their choice amazed her. They wanted her to read them picture books. Why was Zdrojewski so surprised? The students weren't kindergarteners or first graders. They were teenagers!
When most people think of picture books, they think of books with engaging illustrations and very simple text, geared toward very young children, like Brown Bear, Brown Bear, by Eric Carle or Goodnight Moon, by Margaret Wise Brown. But there are many picture books with more sophisticated texts and ideas, geared toward older readers. Included among these are picture book biographies, such as Dorothea Lange, by Carole Boston Weatherford. It's a biography of a famous photographer who photographed life during the Depression. Another example is Fly Away Home, by Eve Bunting, the story of a homeless boy and his father.
A study from the University of North Carolina showed that using picture books with high-school students can improve their understanding and memory of classroom material. Picture books can complement important information in textbooks, helping readers understand the material. Studies also show that picture books can help secondary-school students improve their literacy and literary skills. The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, by Jon Scieszka, is a great book to use when teaching about different points of view.
Mary Jo Fresch, a former professor at Ohio State University, says picture books can help teach higher-level skills while still keeping students' interest. "Not everything is in the pictures and not everything is in the words. It takes some real critical thinking to use a picture book."
Students who are learning English as a second language can also benefit from picture books. The pictures provide visual cues that help the students expand their English vocabulary, and help them with reading comprehension and writing.
Secondary students may be insulted at first when a teacher tries using "baby books" in their lessons. But teachers can preempt these feelings by explaining in advance why they have chosen the book. Eventually, students will accept and appreciate the picture books. As one high-school student said, "They [picture books] help you to understand key life lessons in a fun and easy way."

Picture books have large illustrations and limited text - perfect for beginning readers. But studies have shown that picture books can also help secondary students, and English learners of all ages.
Some picture books have few words on each page, and are about simple ideas. But other picture books have longer, more involved text, and are about sophisticated topics. For example, Dorothea Lange, by Carole Boston Weatherford, is a picture book biography of famous photographer Dorothea Lange, who photographed life during the Depression. Another example is Fly Away Home, by Eve Bunting, a picture book about a homeless boy and his father.

The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, by Jon Scieszka, is a great book to use when teaching the idea of "point of view". Picture books are also helpful for English language learners. The visual cues can help them increase their English vocabulary.
Because older students might be resistant to reading "baby books", teachers should first introduce the picture book, and explain why they chose it. Students will eventually enjoy reading the books.

Millions of children living on the streets or in the slums of India can't go to school. They're busy working or begging to survive. Yet some caring adults have found innovative ways to educate these children.
In 1985, educator Inderjit Khurana was upset by what she saw on her daily commute to Bhubaneswar. There were hundreds of school-aged children, dirty and dressed in rags, working in Bhubaneswar train stations. They were shining shoes, sweeping trains � anything to earn money.
 
Khurana was determined to provide these children with an education, so she set up a school in Bhubaneswar's central station. That way, when the crowds died down, the children could take breaks from work and attend class.
Khurana brought blackboards, children's books, and puppets to her platform school. She used games, songs, dance, and puppet shows to make learning fun. In addition to ordinary subjects, Khurana taught them about hygiene and provided them with food, vitamins, and baths. Soon, the school had 100 students. Eventually, she made more platform schools. Khurana died in 2010, but her platform schools, and her legacy, live on.
In 2013, Shyam Bihari Prasad, a 67-year-old retiree from a telecommunications company, also seized an opportunity to educate children. Prasad saw children begging for food outside a temple he visited regularly in New Delhi. One day, as Prasad was handing out cookies to the children, he realized that giving them food would only benefit them temporarily. But Prasad wanted to help them long-term. So he opened a school � on the sidewalk outside the temple.
"When we first started the pavement classes," says Prasad, "we only had one borrowed mat to sit on.... It did not look like a place of learning." But neighbors donated supplies to the school, including more mats, pencils, books, notebooks, and whiteboards. Today, the school has 35 to 40 students each day. They learn math, Hindi, English, and social sciences. "Our uncle is very good," says 10-year-old Pooja, referring to Prasad. "He gives us knowledge and wisdom."
Khurana and Prasad have given countless children a chance at a brighter future. "If the children cannot come to the school," Khurana used to say, "then the school must come to the children."

He decided to give them something more permanent than food � an education. Prasad taught the children on the sidewalk outside the temple. Neighbors saw Prasad's improvised school, and donated supplies and food. Today, Prasad's "pavement school" has 35-40 students. They learn subjects such as math, Hindi, and English. "He gives us knowledge and wisdom," says 10-year-old Pooja about Prasad.
With caring and creativity, Khurana and Prasad have given impoverished children a chance at a brighter future.

Learning in Unusual Places
Education
Millions of children live on the streets or in the slums of India. They have to work or beg for food and money. They can't go to school. So two people decided to bring school to the children!
In 1985, Inderjit Khurana saw many poor children. They were working in a train station in the city of Bhubaneswar. Khurana wanted to teach these children. So she started a school right in the train station. The children took breaks from work to go to school. Khurana used games, songs, and puppets to teach. She also gave the children food, vitamins, and baths. Khurana died in 2010, but her schools continue.
In 2013, Shyam Bihari Prasad saw many children begging for food. They were begging outside a temple in New Delhi. So Prasad started a school on the sidewalk right outside the temple. Today, Prasad's "pavement school" has 35-40 students. They learn math, Hindi, English, and other subjects.
Because of Khurana and Prasad, many children have a chance at a better life.




Save the Languages!
Education
Today, there are 2,465 endangered languages in the world. A linguist called Inky Gibbens is interested in these languages. She wants to save them, so she started a company. The company is Tribalingual.
How does Tribalingual work? It uses technology.  People visit Tribalingual's Web site. There, they choose an endangered language to study online. Students can watch videos of people speaking the language. They also do reading and listening exercises on their computers. Speaking practice helps people learn a new language, too. Each week, Tribalingual students and teachers have a video chat. The video chats are thirty minutes long.
Today, there are only a few languages on the Tribalingual Web site. In the future, Gibbens says students will be able to learn the Cherokee and Maori languages. Gibbens doesn't want endangered languages to disappear. But can Tribalingual really save them? "It's going to take a long time," says Gibbens, "but I think it's possible."

Education
Inky Gibbens, a sociolinguist, speaks many languages. She was interested in learning Buryat, a Siberian language that her grandparents spoke. While searching for a teacher, Gibbens learned that Buryat is one of 2,465 endangered languages in the world. This inspired Gibbens to try to preserve endangered languages. She founded Tribalingual to make sure that these languages don't become extinct.
Tribalingual is a language-learning company that teaches people to speak endangered languages. Students study online, learning through videos, and reading and listening exercises. They also have 30-minute Skype lessons once a week with a language teacher.
Gibbens believes speaking is the key to preserving a language. Many Tribalingual teachers are native speakers. However, it is hard to find native speakers of endangered languages. Many native speakers of endangered languages are very old, and may not know how to use technology. Also, many live in places with no Internet. So, some Tribalingual courses are taught by people who have studied the language. They may not be native speakers, but they still know a lot about the language and its culture.
Today, Tribalingual teaches just a few languages, such as Ainu, Gangte, and Greko. Ainu is spoken on one island in Japan. Gangte, a Chinese-Tibetan language, is spoken in a few areas in northeast India. And Greko is spoken by less than 300 people in southern Italy. In the future, Tribalingual plans to add more languages, including courses in Cherokee and Maori. But can endangered languages really be saved? "It's going to take a long time," says Gibbens, "but I think it's possible."

Save the Languages!
Education
Inky Gibbens is on a mission. She's getting people to learn languages - not like Russian, Spanish or Chinese, but languages like Ainu, Gangte, and Greko, which are in danger of becoming extinct.
Gibbens, a sociolinguist, is the founder of Tribalingual, an online language-learning company designed to keep endangered languages alive. A language is considered endangered when people no longer speak it on a daily basis, parents no longer teach it to their children, and the only people who speak it fluently are the elderly.
Gibbens began her mission after deciding to learn Buryat, a Siberian language that was the native language of her maternal grandparents. But in her quest to find a teacher, Gibbens learned that Buryat is one of 2,465 endangered languages in the world. Her goal then switched from studying one language to preserving many other languages.
The only way to keep a language alive, reasoned Gibbens, is to teach more people to speak it. And that's what Tribalingual aims to do, through videos, reading and listening exercises, and a 30-minute Skype lesson with a language teacher once a week.
Tribalingual hires teachers who are native language speakers. They pass along knowledge of their culture while teaching the language. As the company Web site states, "To us, language isn't necessarily an object in itself but a way to understand a community and culture, through the eyes of the native speaker."
Finding native speakers to be instructors, however, can be challenging, as they tend to be elderly and may be unfamiliar with technology. They also often live in remote areas with no Internet. So some languages are taught by academics with a strong knowledge of the language and its culture.
Three of the languages now being taught are Ainu, Gangte, and Greko. Ainu is spoken on one island in Japan. Gangte, a Chinese-Tibetan language, is spoken in a few dozen villages in northeast India. And Greko, an ancient form of Greek, is spoken by less than 300 people in southern Italy. Tribalingual currently offers just a few languages, but many more courses, in languages such as Cherokee and Maori, are in the pipeline.
Is there really hope for endangered languages? Can they be saved? "It's going to take a long time," says Gibbens, "but I think it's possible."





Finland's education system is ranked one of the best in the world. However, in an attempt to make their schools and students even more successful, Finland has decided to change the way it teaches.
"We really need a rethinking of education and a redesigning of our system," explains Marjo Kyllonen, the education manager of Helsinki, Finland, "so it prepares our children for the future with the skills that are needed for today and tomorrow."
Traditional subject-specific lessons, such as an hour of math followed by an hour of chemistry, will be replaced with "phenomenon-based" teaching - teaching by topic or event. Phenomenon-based teaching uses a multidisciplinary approach, in which several subjects are taught together while focusing on a single event or topic. The topics, such as a current event or situation, aim to teach students knowledge and skills from a variety of angles. For example, when learning about the European Union, aspects of math, geography, economics, and languages can all be examined.
With this change, students won't need to take an entire course, such as geometry or history, and wonder why they needed to learn it. The aim is to allow students to choose topics that are important to them and which they want to study. While many school systems in other countries may value math and reading above other subjects, Finnish schools view all subjects as equally important. "The goal is to give youngsters a broadly-based education, and not to make them learn single subjects well," says Finnish educational expert Pasi Sahlberg.
The information students learn is not the only thing changing. Students will no longer sit at rows of desks, listening to the teacher lecture, and waiting to answer questions. Instead, students will work collaboratively in small groups, applying the information they learned to solve problems.
Some teachers in Finland are worried that this change will require a lot of cooperation between teachers of different subjects. However, others are looking forward to the change. Around 70% of Helsinki teachers have already been trained in phenomenon-based teaching. "We have really changed the mind-set," says Marjo Kyllonen. "It is quite difficult to get teachers to start and take the first step... but teachers who have taken to the new approach say they can't go back."

Finland Says Goodbye to School Subjects
Education
Finland's education system is one of the best in the world. However, Finland has decided to change the way it teaches. It hopes this change will better prepare students for the future.

"There are schools that are teaching in the old-fashioned way which was of benefit in the beginning of the 1900s," explains Marjo Kyllonen, the education manager of Helsinki, Finland, "- but the needs are not the same, and we need something fit for the 21st century."

Subject-specific lessons, such as math and chemistry, will be replaced with "phenomenon-based" teaching - teaching by topic or event. In phenomenon-based teaching an event or topic is taught through subjects that relate to the topic. Teaching this way will help students learn about a topic from different angles. So for example, when learning about the European Union in the phenomenon-based classroom, math, geography, economics, and languages will all be examined together.

Other changes are also being made. Students will no longer sit at rows of desks, listening to the teacher talk. Instead, students will work together in small groups and apply the information they learned to solve problems.

Some teachers in Finland are concerned about the change. They are worried it will require a lot of cooperation between teachers of different subjects.

Finland Says Goodbye to School Subjects
Education
The schools in Finland are very good. But Finland wants to make them even better. So it plans to change the way it teaches.

Most schools teach classes about subjects, like math or history. Finland wants to replace these types of classes. Classes will now focus on topics or events. The topics will teach students information and skills in a different way. In these classes, students will learn many subjects together. For example, in the class "Working in a Restaurant", students will learn about business. They will also work on their math, and learn how to communicate better. Lessons can be about events, like elections. They can also be about topics, like water and energy.

Finland will make other changes, too. Students won't sit at desks, listening to the teacher talk. They will work together in small groups to solve problems.

Finland hopes these changes will make students ready for the future.





In a regular classroom, students sit in class. The teacher talks and the students listen. At home, they do homework. The flipped classroom is the opposite. Students watch the lessons on their home computers. They do their 'homework' in class. For 'homework', they do group projects. The teacher walks around and helps them.

At a school in Michigan (U.S.), many students were failing math and science. So the school made two classes. One was a flipped classroom. The other was a regular classroom. In the regular classroom, the students failed again. But in the flipped classroom, the students did much better. The school decided to flip all the classes.

People had the idea for flipped classrooms in 2000. But technology wasn't good enough to make the idea work. In 2004, Jonathan Bergman and Aaron Sams were the first teachers to flip their classrooms. They found special software to record their lessons.

Today, flipped classrooms are getting more and more popular. They may turn teaching on its head.

The Flipped Classroom
Education
In a regular classroom, students usually sit at desks and watch the teacher lecture. When they go home, they do homework. The flipped classroom is just the opposite.

In flipped classrooms, students watch teachers' lectures at home on their computers. They do 'homework' in the classroom. Homework is group projects that students work on while the teacher walks around helping them. What is good about this method? It works!

At a high school in Michigan (U.S.), many students were failing math and science. So, the school decided to divide the students into two classes. One was a flipped classroom. The other was a traditional classroom. After 20 weeks, students in the flipped classroom brought their grades up to a C+ or higher. The students in the traditional classroom did not improve. The school decided to flip every class.

Two high school science teachers named Jonathan Bergman and Aaron Sams were the first to flip their classes. In 2004, they needed a solution for students who missed class. Bergman and Sams found software they could use to make their lessons into video presentations. By 2007, they were recording all of their lessons. By the next year, they had all of their students watch the lessons at home. They used class time to talk about what they learned and do projects. Bergman and Sams even found solutions for students without Internet, including downloading lectures onto cellphones.

The concept of the flipped classroom isn't new. It was first presented in a paper published in 2000. Technology was not advanced enough to make it work then. But with today's technology, the flipped classroom is flipping the education system on its head!

The Flipped Classroom
Education
When you picture a classroom, you probably picture students sitting at desks, watching the teacher lecture, and then going home to do homework. But flip that image in your head, and you get a different kind of classroom - the flipped classroom.

In the flipped classroom, students watch teachers' lectures at home, and then go to the classroom to do 'homework'. Lectures are pre-recorded, and students watch them on their home computers. 'Homework' is group projects that students work on while the teacher walks around, offering guidance.

The flipped classroom concept isn't new, but it has recently taken off. This is due to improved technology, and to positive research findings.

One experiment was conducted in a high school in Michigan (U.S.), in which many students were failing math and science. The school divided the students into two classes. One was a flipped classroom, and the other was a traditional classroom. The students in the flipped classroom brought their grades up to a C+ or higher, after only 20 weeks. The students in the traditional classroom showed no improvement. The flipped classroom worked. As a result, the administration flipped every class in the school.

The success of the flipped classroom is attributed to high school science teachers Jonathan Bergman and Aaron Sams. They started using the method in 2004, as a solution for students who missed class. Bergman and Sams discovered software that allowed them to record their lectures and turn them into video presentations. By 2007, they were recording and sharing all of their lessons. By the next year, they were requiring all students to watch the lessons at home, and use class time to discuss and experiment with the material. Bergman and Sams even found ways to adapt the method for students without Internet access, including downloading lectures onto cellphones. Today, Bergman and Sams have their own Web site and even host boot camps, and teacher workshops.

But Bergman and Sams didn't invent the flipped classroom. The concept was first presented in a paper published in 2000, called 'Inverting the Classroom'. But technology was not advanced enough to implement it. With today's technology, however, the flipped classroom finally stands a chance of flipping the entire education system on its head!




A Rolling Robot That Helps Kids Learn
Education
Learning with robots is an educational and enjoyable experience. Children with autism respond especially well to robots, making them useful for teaching new skills. Studies have shown that robots can even be as useful as humans at helping children with autism learn. Ladislas de Toldi designed a robot that helps these children - he calls it 'Leka'.
One of de Toldi's graduate school professors asked the students to design a toy to help children with autism communicate and interact. De Toldi's design developed into Leka - that small, round, rolling robot with a speaker and a screen. Leka can change colors, play music, vibrate, and even laugh. Users play interactive educational games, such as bingo and hide-and-seek.
Many children with autism have difficulty communicating and focusing on tasks. Spending time with Leka can help them develop their emotional, cognitive, and motor skills. Leka's predictable actions make children with autism feel safe. Also, children with autism need a lot of repetition to learn something new, but Leka never gets tired. "Always doing the same thing can be hard for a parent or caregiver - but Leka will do the same thing every single time," says de Toldi.
Some people think Leka is too expensive (at about $400 dollars). Others believe that the iPad is just as beneficial. But de Toldi says that the iPad doesn't have the ability to use the whole body to interact with it.
Leka's motion sensors respond to individual actions. For example, if Leka is thrown down, it turns red, indicating sadness. Leka's reactions help improve social skills - children learn how their actions affect others. Leka electronically records all its interactions. Then, parents and caregivers can track the child's progress via a special app. Leka's settings (level of difficulty, speed, etc.) can be adjusted according to the individual child.
Although Leka was developed for children with autism, children with other types of developmental disabilities can benefit, too. Leka will have even more apps in the future, expanding its capabilities. One parent says, "I think that Leka is really bringing something new and inspirational for children." Watch the video about Leka, and see what you think.

But Leka never gets tired.
 
Some people think Leka is too expensive (at about $400 dollars). Others believe that children can use an iPad instead. But the iPad "doesn't have the ability to use the whole body to interact with it," de Toldi says. Also, as a child learns, parents and caregivers can customize Leka's settings for each child, and follow the child's progress.
In the future, Leka will have even more activities. One parent says, "I think that Leka is really bringing something new and inspirational for children." Watch the video about Leka, and see what you think.

Children with autism enjoy learning from robots. Ladislas de Toldi invented a special robot to help these children. Meet 'Leka'.
Leka looks like a ball. Leka has a screen. You can see Leka's "face" on the screen. Leka changes colors, vibrates, and plays music. It makes different sounds. It even laughs!
Children with autism like Leka's games. They can play bingo and hide-and-seek with Leka. Children with autism like doing the same thing again and again - so does Leka. Leka also helps them learn new skills. For example, sometimes a child throws Leka down too hard. Leka doesn't like that. Leka turns red. The child understands that Leka is "sad." This helps children with autism learn to communicate better.
Parents like Leka, too. Leka "remembers" what their child learns. Then, parents use a special app to see how their child is improving.
One parent says, "I think that Leka is really bringing something new and inspirational for children." What do you think of Leka?





Kindergarten is a fun place where young children learn. In some special kindergartens, children learn outside most of the day!
Some kindergartens are in the forest. In these "forest kindergartens," children play freely. They're outside in all kinds of weather. At forest kindergartens, children learn by climbing trees and picking fruit. They also learn about and take care of animals. For example, they collect chicken eggs and feed baby mice.
Little Flower Kindergarten is in Dong Nai, Vietnam. At this school, children learn about farming. They also learn that it is important to eat healthy food. They grow vegetables in gardens - on the roof! They eat the vegetables they grow in their lunches.
At Fuji Kindergarten in Tokyo, Japan, trees grow inside the building! The classroom windows and sliding doors stay open to the outside most of the year. The roof is a big, wooden circle. Children love to play and run on it.
Which outside kindergarten seems like fun to you?

Bringing the Learning Outdoors
Education
How much time do you think kindergarten children should spend outside? In some kindergartens, children do most of their learning and playing outdoors!
"Forest kindergartens" started in Denmark, but today you can find them all over the world. Children play freely, hike, and explore their forest "classroom." Each day they can climb trees, pick fruit, or play hide-and-seek. They are outside no matter what the weather is. Children also learn about animals. For example, they can collect chicken eggs and feed baby mice. Studies show that forest kindergartens improve children's imaginations and self-esteem.
At Little Flower Kindergarten in Dong Nai, Vietnam, the focus is on farming. Children play on the roof of the school building, which is filled with grass, flowers, and vegetable gardens. Children grow spinach, mustard greens, and sweet potatoes. This food is used in the school lunches. This way, children learn about nature and healthy eating habits. Inside the classrooms, they study other subjects, such as music and painting.
Fuji Kindergarten in Tokyo, Japan has trees growing right through the middle of the building! The windows and sliding doors stay open to the outside most of the year. Children love to play and run on the kindergarten's circular, wooden roof. There is even a slide that goes from this roof, down to the ground. Here children learn according to the Montessori method - each child is respected for their abilities. The school's architect, Takaharu Tezuka, believes that children "need to tumble sometimes... And that makes them learn how to live in this world."
Being outside is important at these kindergartens. Which one sounds the most interesting to you?

Bringing the Learning Outdoors
Education
Would you like to go back to kindergarten? What if you could spend all your time there outside? There are kindergartens where the children's educational experiences occur mostly, or entirely, outdoors.
The idea of "forest kindergartens" started in Denmark, and today children all over the world attend these types of kindergartens. Forest kindergartens are less structured than traditional kindergartens. Children play freely, hike, and explore their "classroom" - the forest. Activities can include climbing trees, picking fruit, and playing hide-and-seek, no matter what the weather is. Children learn about caring for animals while gathering chicken eggs and feeding newborn mice. Studies show that all this time spent on free-play improves children's imaginations, increases their self-esteem, and makes them more independent.
At Little Flower Kindergarten in Dong Nai, Vietnam, farming is the main focus of the curriculum. The school building is clover-shaped. Children play on a roof filled with grass, flowers, and vegetables. They study food cultivation in vegetable and herb gardens - growing spinach, mustard greens, and sweet potatoes. The harvested food is used in school lunches which encourages healthy eating habits. Leftover vegetables are sent home with the children. Inside the classrooms, they study additional subjects such as music and painting. Architect Takashi Niwa helped design the kindergarten. "This is a place where children can learn the importance of agriculture and their relationship with nature," he says.
Fuji Kindergarten in Tokyo is the largest kindergarten in Japan. It also has trees growing right through the middle of the building! The trees are there for children to climb and enjoy. Here, children learn according to the Montessori method - centered on respecting each child's unique abilities. At this school, windows and sliding doors stay open most of the year. "There is no boundary between inside and outside," says Takaharu Tezuka, the school's architect. He believes that children "need to tumble sometimes... And that makes them learn how to live in this world." Children spend hours playing and running on the school's circular, wooden roof - there is even a slide that goes from this roof down to the ground.

Do These Languages Have a Future?
Education
There are more than 6,000 languages in the world. Half of them are disappearing, and could become extinct by the end of the century. Have you ever heard Cherokee or Gwich'in being spoken? These are just two of the thousands of languages that are considered endangered. To save these languages, people are starting to use technology and social media.
A language is considered endangered when there are too few people using it. Some languages are only oral, not written. Once people stop speaking the language with each other, it becomes endangered. Another threat to a language is not passing it on to the next generation. For instance, immigrant parents may use only the language of their new country, instead of teaching their children their native language.
 
Why do endangered languages need saving? Linguist Mark Turin believes disappearing languages deserve the same attention as endangered animals. Another linguist, Lenore Grenoble, says, "People feel the loss of their language in a very personal way." It often means losing the culture and wisdom embedded in the language. For example, in the Cherokee language, there is no word for good-bye, only, "I will see you again." Words for many natural objects also include important information as part of the word. The name of a plant could include information about whether it's poisonous or not.
Technology and social media is helping save languages from all over the world. For example, there are many Cherokee language tools, including an app for texting in Cherokee. Ayapaneco, spoken by only two people, is a Mexican language that is also at risk. There is a website where visitors can listen to a word, record a video of themselves saying the word, and then share it on social media. Gwich'in, a North American indigenous language, is spoken by less than 400 people in Alaska and Canada. Jacey Firth, a Gwich'in speaker, started a social media campaign called #SpeakGwichinToMe to promote awareness of the language.
For some, it is hard to let go of these "disappearing" languages. According to Firth, "As long as I'm speaking it and teaching myself, and I'm teaching others, it's like a light that will never go out."

Do These Languages Have a Future?
Education
There are more than 6,000 languages in the world. But half of these languages are disappearing, and could become extinct by the end of 2099. Most people haven't heard Cherokee, Gwich'in, or Ayapaneco being spoken - but that might soon change. People are starting to use technology and social media to save these disappearing languages.
A language becomes "endangered" when there are too few people using the language, and it's not being passed on to children. When a language disappears, the knowledge that comes with that language disappears, too. For example, in the Cherokee language, words for many objects in nature also include important information as part of the word. A plant's name could include information about whether it's poisonous or not.
Technology is helping save languages from all over the world. For example, there is an app for texting in Cherokee, a native language of North America. There is also a website for the endangered Mexican language, Ayapaneco, which is spoken by only two people in the world. Anyone can visit the website to learn words in Ayapaneco.
Social media is helping save Gwich'in, a North American indigenous language. Less than 400 people in the world speak it. Jacey Firth, a Gwich'in speaker, wanted to promote awareness of the language. She started a social media campaign called #SpeakGwichinToMe.
Some speakers of "disappearing" languages are refusing to let the languages go. Firth says, "As long as I'm speaking it and teaching myself, and I'm teaching others, it's like a light that will never go out."

Do These Languages Have a Future?
Education
There are thousands of endangered languages in the world. Some people want to save these languages by using technology.
Cherokee is one endangered language. Over time, people in North America stopped speaking Cherokee to their children. In 2005, some Cherokee speakers in North Carolina, USA decided to teach the language to children. Today, children can learn Cherokee online. There is also an app for texting in Cherokee. The language is still endangered. But slowly, more people are speaking and understanding Cherokee.
The Gwich'in language is also in trouble. Less than 400 people in Alaska and Canada speak Gwich'in. Jacey Firth wants to save Gwich'in. She uses social media to teach people Gwich'in. People can ask questions about the language on her website.
Ayapaneco is an endangered Mexican language. Only two people speak Ayapaneco! In 2014, Professor James Fox started a website for Ayapaneco. People learn words from the website. They make videos of themselves saying the words. Then, they share the videos on the Internet.
Cherokee, Gwich'in, and Ayapaneco may now have a future - all thanks to technology!




Welcome to Viking School
Education
Jeppe Nordmann Garly loves Viking culture. The Vikings lived in Scandinavia around a thousand years ago. They were warriors and craftspeople. They sailed around the world in large ships. Garly used to learn about Vikings for fun. Today, Garly is the world's first Viking teacher!

Garly teaches Viking Studies at the Seljord Folk High School in Norway He wants students to learn about Viking skills. For example, students learn to make things out of metal. They make swords and knives. But, they don't fight with them. Students learn how to bake bread and fix roofs. They carve wood. Students also sew their own Viking-style clothes. They use leather to make boots, too. They wear these clothes during their classes.

Many of Garly's students enjoy TV shows about Vikings. They feel excited and proud to be studying Viking life. Garly is happy to teach them how to live like a "full-time" Viking.

Welcome to Viking School
Education
Many young people in Norway take a year off between high school and university, and use that year to study at "folk high schools." At these boarding schools, students can study everything from dance to computers. Now, there is an exciting new option - Viking Studies.
Arve Husby is the principal of Seljord Folk High School. He wanted to add some new programs to the school. During a meeting, one teacher suggested Viking skills as part of a program to get students working with their hands. The program was developed, and the school searched for a teacher. Twenty-two people applied for the job to teach the new Viking Studies program. Jeppe Nordmann Garly, from Denmark, was chosen. He calls himself "the first Viking teacher."
In August 2015, 14 students - five female and nine male - began the Viking Studies program. So what do they learn? Students study Viking skills, such as wood carving, baking bread, and roof thatching. They learn to make their own jewelry, knives, and cookware. Students even dress like Vikings throughout the course. They sew their own Viking-style clothes and learn to make boots from leather. They also practice boating skills, and visit real Viking ships at the Viking museum in Oslo (only 90 miles away from Seljord).
According to Principal Husby, "Everyone was very skeptical. They said, 'What is this Viking thing?'" However, TV shows about Vikings have made more students interested in Viking culture. The program allows students to experience first-hand what Viking life was like. What do you think - is the Viking life for you?

Many students in Norway, between the ages of 18-25, take a year off between high school and university. They choose to study at boarding schools called "folk high schools." Students at folk high schools are encouraged to learn about themselves, develop their own interests, and learn how to be more independent. These schools offer programs in everything from dance to computers - without giving exams or grades. Now, there is an exciting new option - Viking Studies.
The principal of Seljord Folk High School, Arve Husby, wanted to add some new programs to the school. The idea of Viking studies was suggested during "a brainstorming" session with other teachers. Husby says the suggestion to include Viking skills was to get students working with their hands. A job advertisement for a program director was posted on social media - and shared 26,000 times! Out of 22 applicants, the school chose Jeppe Nordmann Garly. Garly is from Denmark, where he was a teacher and jewelry maker. He calls himself "the first Viking teacher."
In August 2015, 14 students - five female and nine male - began the Viking Studies program. So what do they learn? Students study traditional Viking skills, such as wood carving, weaving, baking bread, and roof thatching. The program emphasizes Viking craftsmanship. Students learn to make their own jewelry, knives, and cookware. Students even dress like Vikings throughout the course. They sew their own Viking-style clothes and learn to make boots from leather. They also learn boating skills, and visit real Viking ships at the Viking museum in Oslo (only 90 miles away from Seljord). As part of the program, students get to visit York, England which was invaded by Vikings in the 9th century. There, students can view many interesting Viking artifacts.
According to Principal Husby, "Everyone was very skeptical. They said, 'What is this Viking thing?'" However, TV shows about Vikings have made more students interested in Viking culture. The program gives students a hands-on experience on what Viking life was like. What do you think - is the Viking life for you?

Each year, millions of students flock to university campuses, suitcases in hand, to begin their studies. But not all students study on a campus. Some study online. They take online courses called MOOCs (massive open online courses). MOOCs have been gaining popularity since 2008. One reason is that these courses are free.
To post MOOCs online, universities turn to companies such as edX. EdX provides the platform needed to upload courses to the Internet. According to Anant Agarwal, the CEO of edX, all that MOOC students need is the will to learn and an Internet connection.
But what makes MOOC a worthwhile alternative to face-to-face learning? Like traditional courses, MOOCs have lectures, exams, and homework assignments. But in MOOCS, the coursework is done online. And since students can learn anywhere there is Internet, they have more flexibility, so they can fit studying into their busy lives. MOOC also allows people all over the world to participate in the same courses.
After a professor posts a video lecture, students can watch it as many times as necessary. This helps students absorb the material being taught, at their own pace. Many professors divide long videos into shorter parts, according to topic. Students can skip the topics they already know and move on to new material. After most lectures, there is a short fact-based quiz to make sure students understand the main points. And while MOOC students are given deadlines, they can submit assignments multiple times in order to improve their grades.
Each MOOC has its own online discussion forum, the online equivalent of class discussions. Forums are also the place where students can ask the professors for help. Forums give students the opportunity to communicate with other people and feel connected. They provide social opportunities often lacking in online learning.

MOOC providers such as edX usually partner with recognized universities to make sure their classes are at a high level of education. Yet, some educators think that MOOCs don't provide the same level of education as face-to-face courses. And although MOOC providers award course completion certificates, many universities won't accept MOOC credits toward a degree.
Still, millions of people are happy with MOOC and continue to enroll. Maybe you'll find a MOOC that's right for you!

Each year, millions of students take university courses. But some of these students have never been inside a university. These students study online. They take online courses called MOOCs. MOOC stands for massive open online courses. They are free, and open to everyone.
MOOCs have been around since 2008. Today, they are very popular. EdX is a company that puts the university courses online. The CEO of edX, Anant Agarwal, says that all a MOOC student needs is a will to learn and an Internet connection.
Like regular classrooms, MOOCs have lectures, exams, and homework assignments. But MOOC students can watch lectures as many times as they want. And while the students are given deadlines, they can redo assignments until they are satisfied with their grades. There are quizzes after every lecture to make sure students understand what they learned.
MOOCs are perfect for students who have busy lives. They can do coursework any time of day, wherever there is Wi-Fi. MOOCs also allow people all over the world to take the same courses.
Each MOOC has its own discussion forum. In a forum, students discuss the lesson with other students. Students also use forums to ask the professor questions. Forums help online learners feel connected to other people.
Companies like edX usually work with universities to make sure MOOC courses are on a high level. Still, some educators think MOOC students don't learn as much as students taking face-to-face courses.

Imagine an outside landscape where everything is made of blocks. In this world, you can explore forever, mine natural resources, and build structures. This is the world of Minecraft - a computer game. In this game, almost anything you want can be created. Most people play at home, but teachers and students are now realizing that Minecraft can also be used to teach and learn.
In Minecraft, players create their own world by building structures from resources. In 'survival mode', players focus on staying alive. They mine resources, build shelter, find food, and fight monsters. In 'creative mode', players have all the resources they need and concentrate on building anything they imagine, such as the Pyramids in Egypt, or a copy of their home. In 'multiplayer mode', players work together to mine resources and build structures.
There are many ways teachers can use Minecraft in the classroom. Students can explore Minecraft copies of real places, like the Colosseum in Rome. For literature class, students can read a scene in a Shakespeare play and build the setting in Minecraft. Students studying a foreign language can use the language they are learning to work together on a Minecraft assignment. The possibilities are endless.
To help teachers use Minecraft in the classroom, Joel Levin created MinecraftEdu. MinecraftEdu is a special version of Minecraft for the classroom. It gives teachers extra control over the game and free lesson plans for using Minecraft. Teachers in 42 countries in six continents are already using MinecraftEdu to teach.
Both teachers and students are excited about using Minecraft in the classroom. In Minecraft, the sky really is the limit!

Imagine an infinite outside landscape where it looks like everything is made of blocks. Here you can explore forever, mine natural resources, and build structures. This is the world of Minecraft, where almost anything you desire can be created. Minecraft is the best-selling computer game of all time. Until recently, it was mostly played at home, but now it is entering the classroom. Teachers and students are now realizing how Minecraft can be used to teach and learn.
In Minecraft, players create their own virtual world by building structures made from mined resources. Players start with an empty landscape. In 'survival mode', they must work to find resources from the land to provide for their needs - shelter, safety, and food. In 'creative mode', players have access to all the resources they need and do not need to focus on survival. Instead, they can focus on building anything they imagine - the Pyramids in Egypt, or even a copy of their own home. In 'multiplayer mode', players can work together to mine resources and build structures.
There are many ways Minecraft can be used in the classroom. Students can explore Minecraft copies of real places, such as the Colosseum in Rome. For a literature assignment, students can read a scene in a Shakespeare play and reconstruct it from the details they have read. If students are studying a foreign language, they can work on a collaborative Minecraft assignment in the language they are learning. In any subject, the possibilities are endless.
The magazine, Scientific American, wrote "...not only is Minecraft immersive and creative, but it is an excellent platform for making almost any subject area more engaging."
To help teachers use Minecraft in the classroom, Joel Levin created MinecraftEdu. MinecraftEdu describes itself as "...a version of Minecraft designed by teachers for classroom use. It contains many additions to the original game that make it more useful and appropriate in a school setting." MinecraftEdu provides teachers with extra control over the game's settings and offers lesson plans to support teachers' use of Minecraft in the classroom.

Book Buddies That Bark
Education
You might know how scary it can be to read aloud to an audience, especially if you find reading difficult. You are afraid to make mistakes, afraid to stumble on words and pronunciations. Now, imagine sitting down and reading to a cat or dog. The animal doesn't know if you make a mistake. The cat purrs. The dog wags its tails. You relax. Reading aloud becomes more enjoyable. You begin to look forward to it, even if it might be hard.

From America to Estonia to Australia, sprouting up in schools, animal shelters, and libraries, are innovative reading programs that use cats and dogs to encourage children to read. At the Animal Rescue League of Berks County in Pennsylvania, children read books to cats as part of the Book Buddies program. The Book Buddies program was started by Kristi Rodriguez, whose 10 year old son Sean, struggled with reading. Kristi started this program to give children opportunities to practice reading in a non-judgmental environment, while giving the animals affection. It's a win-win situation.

According to studies performed at Tufts University in America, "Human-animal interactions can make the learning process more comfortable and enjoyable for children," and that "pets can be considered a source of support." A 2010 University of California study found that when children read to dogs once a week, their reading fluency improved by 12-30%.
Parents and teachers say the children's behavior also changed. The children became more confident, proud of their accomplishments, and more likely to volunteer to read aloud in class.   

The animals benefit from the reading programs as well. In Hamilton, Montana, kids read to shelter animals. "We've seen that the sound of their voices is soothing for the dogs and cats," says the program's director. "It is relaxing to the dogs to hear those calm and steady voices."

These reading programs are aimed at children, but reading can be challenging at any age. Reading aloud to a dog or cat can ease that challenge and make reading more enjoyable. So grab a book, your closest furry friend, and enjoy a good book together.

If you think it is scary to read out loud, read to a cat or dog. If you make a mistake, the animal won't know. The cat will purr. The dog will wag its tail.

In schools, animal shelters, and libraries, cats and dogs are helping children read.  In the U.S., there is a group called Book Buddies. In this group, children read books to cats in a shelter. The children feel safe reading to the cats. The cats don't know when the children make a mistake.

Children in these groups become more confident readers. They also start volunteering to read out loud in class. A study found that when children read to dogs, their reading improved 12-30%.

The animals also enjoy the reading groups. They like the attention they get when the children read to them.

Reading to an animal can make reading easier. It can also make reading more fun. So find a furry friend and read a good book together.
