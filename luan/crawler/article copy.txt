Traveling in Their Footsteps
World
Many people know about Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus. They were explorers who traveled around the world. But Elise Wortley wants people to know about female explorers too.
Wortley reads books about the journeys of great female explorers. She learns what they wore on their journeys. She learns what equipment they took with them. She learns what they ate. Then, Wortley "follows in their footsteps." She travels to the same places. She wears the same kind of clothes. She carries the same kind of equipment. She eats the same foods.
Alexandra David-Neel was a French-Belgian explorer. She traveled through Asia at the beginning of the 1900s. One place Neel visited was India. So, Wortley visited India too. She wore a wool coat like David-Neel's. At night, she slept in a canvas tent, like David-Neel.
Nan Shepherd explored Scotland in the 1940's. She walked through the Cairngorm Mountains. So, Wortley walked through the Cairngorm Mountains too. Wortley wore leather boots. The boots look like Shepherd's boots.
Wortley hopes her trips will inspire new female explorers.

Elise Wortley loves traveling. She is also very interested in female explorers of the past - women who took journeys all over the world. Female explorers had many achievements. But most aren't well-known, because they were women. Wortley wants people to learn about female explorers. So, she "follows in their footsteps," by recreating their journeys.
On her journeys, Wortley travels the same routes the female explorers took. She wears the same kind of clothes they wore. She eats the same kinds of foods they ate, and uses the same kind of equipment they used. On one trek, she made a wooden backpack from an old chair. To plan her trips, Wortley learns all she can about the women's journeys. Then, travel experts help her plan the best routes.
One of Wortley's treks was in India, where she recreated the journey of Alexandra David-Neel. David-Neel was a French-Belgian explorer. She traveled in the early 1900's. David-Neel traveled through China, India, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. When recreating David-Neel's India journey, Wortley slept under an old canvas tent and wore a heavy wool coat. It was actually David-Neel's book about her travels, called My Journey to Lhasa, that got Wortley interested in travel. She first read the book when she was 16 years old.
Another explorer who inspired Wortley was Nan Shepherd. Shepherd walked all over Scotland's Cairngorm Mountains. On her trip, Wortley dressed like Shepherd did in the 1940's. Under her coat she wore a cotton blouse, wool tights, socks, and a sweater. She also had leather boots. For light, Wortley used candles, just like Shepherd.
Wortley hopes her travels into the past will inspire the female adventurers of the future!

Traveling in Their Footsteps
World
Have you heard of the explorers Alexandra David-Neel, Nan Shepherd, or Freya Stark? Probably not. And Elise Wortley thinks that's a shame. Wortley wants people to learn about explorers who have been overlooked by history, because they were women.
To raise awareness of their achievements, Wortley has been recreating the journeys of some great female explorers from the past. She travels the same routes, wears clothes they would have worn, eats the same foods, and uses the same kind of equipment. This means no modern technology!
Wortley plans her trips carefully. She consults travel experts and local guides. Researching explorers' clothing and equipment is one of her favorite parts of the planning. In India, she wore a heavy wool coat, and carried a basket that she tied together with rope. She also had a wooden backpack she made from an old chair.
One female explorer was Alexandra David-Neel. She was a French-Belgian explorer who traveled through China, India, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia, and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When following her route, Wortley slept under an old canvas tent. She also relied on two hot water bottles to stay warm in the freezing Himalayas!
Back when Wortley was 16, she read David-Neel's book My Journey to Lhasa. "The book opened my teenage eyes to the incredible story of a woman traveling," she says. After college, Wortley worked for a travel company, where her love for travel blossomed. Then, in her late 20's, she decided to go to India to retrace David-Neel's route.
Another explorer Wortley followed was Nan Shepherd, an early 20th century Scottish writer who explored Scotland's Cairngorm Mountains. Wortley walked through the mountains and climbed Ben Nevis, the tallest peak in the United Kingdom. She wore clothes from the 1940's - a cotton blouse, wool tights, socks, and a sweater, plus a tweed coat, and leather boots. Wortley brought candles for light, and a gas cooker for cooking food.
Wortley has followed in the footsteps of other female explorers too, including British-Italian explorer and travel writer Freya Stark. Stark visited Iran's Alamut Valley in the 1930's. And Wortley's list keeps growing. By bringing more female explorers of the past to people's attention, Wortley hopes to inspire the next generation of female adventurers.

Iceland. Bangladesh. Portugal. Ecuador. Japan. These are just a few of the many countries Trevor Rainbolt has traveled to - without ever leaving his computer chair! The 23-year-old from Los Angeles, California, USA, is a professional GeoGuessr player. GeoGuessr is an online geography game where players have to guess a mystery location as quickly as possible. The more exact a player's guess is, the more points they earn.
In GeoGuessr, players are shown one 360-degree panoramic picture from Google Maps Street View, which shows users images taken from different spots across the globe. Then, players zoom in, looking for clues. Details such as trees and plants, street signs, and even shadows, all help pinpoint a location. For example, France is the only country that has blue stickers on their utility poles. So, if you see the blue stickers you'll know you're in France. In GeoGuessr, players are also exposed to the cultural aspects of each area, such as its language and architecture.
After years of exploring the world through GeoGuessr, Rainbolt can name the country in any picture in under a second. In 2021, Rainbolt started posting videos of himself playing GeoGuessr on social media. Today, he has more than 600,000 followers. Rainbolt also posts videos giving tips to help other GeoGuessr players. "I would recommend learning what side of the road most countries drive on," he says. Then, when you see how people are driving their cars, you'll be able to narrow down the country.
If you figured out that your image was taken in the USA, Rainbolt has facts to help you identify which of the 50 states it was taken in. For example, Oregon is the only state that doesn't have the word "limit" on their speed limit signs.
Rainbolt has been enjoying his GeoGuessr journey. He says he learned so much about the world that he never would have known without the game. "If anyone out there is trying to see the world and experience different cultures," he says, "GeoGuessr is such a good way to do it." Playing GeoGuessr has even inspired Rainbolt to get up from his chair, and travel to see the places on his computer screen, in person!

Trevor Rainbolt has an interesting job. This 23-year-old from Los Angeles, California, USA, is a professional GeoGuessr player. GeoGuessr is an online geography game. Players are shown a picture from a random location on Earth. Then, they have to guess the location as quickly and as accurately as possible. The more exact a player's guess is, the more points they get.
In GeoGuessr, players are shown one 360-degree photo from Google Maps Street View. (Street View shows users images taken from different locations across the globe.) Players can make the image larger to look for clues, such as special trees, or certain shadows. Players can look for cultural differences, such as signs in a certain language, or a special type of building. It's also helpful to notice the side of the street cars are driving on.
In 2021, Rainbolt started posting videos about GeoGuessr on social media. On some videos he's playing the game. On others, he's giving tips and clues to players. One clue, for example, is that France is the only country with blue stickers on its utility poles. For pictures from the USA, Rainbolt helps players identify the state. Oregon, for example, has speed limit signs that are different from those of all other US states. 
Rainbolt has been playing GeoGuessr since 2016. Today, he can correctly guess the country in the picture in under a second. Rainbolt says he has learned a lot about the world playing GeoGuessr, without ever leaving his computer chair. "If anyone out there is trying to see the world and experience different cultures," he says, "GeoGuessr is such a good way to do it."

Do you like to travel? Play GeoGuessr! GeoGuessr is an online game. You look at a 360-degree photo of someplace in the world. What place is it? You have to guess!
Trevor Rainbolt is a professional GeoGuessr player. You can see his videos online. Rainbolt helps players play GeoGuessr. Rainbolt teaches people to look for clues. To look for clues, Rainbolt makes the photo larger. Does he see plants or trees? Plants or trees can be clues. Some countries have special trees. Rainbolt also looks at the styles of buildings. What country has that style of building?
Many GeoGuessr photos show cars and roads. Look at the cars and roads to get information. Do cars drive on the right or left side of the road? This is another clue. Street signs help too. Players look at letters or numbers on the signs.
Rainbolt and other GeoGuessr players learn geography when they play. They "travel" around the world in their chairs!

Dream Home - Dream Price?

Italy is famous for art, history, and culture - not to mention incredible food. Visitors come to enjoy its beautiful Mediterranean beaches, majestic mountains, and breathtaking natural sites. While tourism is on the rise, however, the population of Italy has been declining recently. Small towns have been affected the most, as many young people leave rural areas to settle in cities or go abroad, where job prospects are better. Worried about their future, some of these towns are using a creative approach to revitalize the local population numbers - by offering houses that cost just one euro!
Many people who saw advertisements for one-euro homes were sure it was a joke. But not everyone. Australian Mark Kopun was traveling in Europe when he heard about the homes. Excited and intrigued, he set off for the sunny town of Mussomeli in Sicily to check it out. "When I got there, I fell in love with the place and the people," says Kopun. As to the one-euro homes, it was much more expensive than that! All of the homes in Mussomeli are run-down and need extensive renovations, including Kopun's. Kopun believes he'll probably spend around �20,000 to fix up his "one-euro house" - but that's still a great deal! And for people who prefer moving right in, there are towns such as Biccari in southeast Italy offering inexpensive houses that don't need any work at all.
Many of the homebuyers snapping up these bargains are from the USA, China, Argentina, and different parts of Europe, in addition to Australia. Even before the COVID-19 crisis complicated international travel, many foreign buyers only saw the houses over the Internet before buying. Meredith Tabbone from Illinois, USA, bid �5,555 at an auction for a three-bedroom house in Sambuca, Sicily - and won! Although Tabbone had never been to Sambuca before, she was pleasantly surprised when she arrived. "At the end, it turned out to be much better than I thought," says Tabbonne. And how do her new neighbors feel? "The locals are very excited to have people coming back to move to their town. They're very warm, friendly, sweet, and curious," says Tabbonne.
For these new homeowners, their dream house keys unlock an Italian adventure!

Tourists love sunny Italy for its culture, beautiful nature, and delicious food. Many people visit, but the number of residents has been going down recently. Young people - especially from small towns - leave home to find jobs in the big cities or abroad. In small towns all over Italy, people are worried that their population numbers are shrinking. The solution? Some towns are hoping to attract new residents with houses that cost just one euro!
Many people who saw advertisements for "one-euro homes" thought it was a joke. Mark Kopun from Australia wanted to see for himself, so he went to the town of Mussomeli in Sicily. "When I got there, I fell in love with the place and the people," he says. He bought a one-euro home, but it needed renovations. Kopun believes he'll probably spend around �20,000 to fix up his "one-euro home," but that's still a bargain!
Buyers for one-euro homes come from all over Europe, USA, China, Argentina, and other places. Some only see pictures on the Internet before buying. Meredith Tabbone, from Illinois, USA, bought a house in Sambuca, Sicily, without visiting first. The town held an auction with prices starting at one euro. Tabbone bid �5,555 for a three-bedroom house - and she won! When she finally went to Sambuca, Tabbone was pleasantly surprised by her new home. "It turned out to be much better than I thought," she says, although it cost more than one euro. Tabbone also likes her Italian neighbors who are excited to have new people move into town.
For bargain hunters like Kopun and Tabbone, their dream homes are the beginning of an Italian adventure!

Italy is a beautiful country. Tourists love to visit! But Italy has a problem. There aren't a lot of jobs in Italy's small towns. Young people from small towns go to big cities to find work. This is bad for the small towns. They need more people.
One town had an idea. Cheap homes will bring new people. Now, they sell homes for one euro!
Mark Kopun is from Australia. He bought a one-euro home in a small town called Mussomeli. First, Kobun must fix his new home. Then, he can live there. Kobun will pay around �20,000 to fix the house. But Kobun is happy. He thinks �20,000 for a house is a bargain!
Meredith Tabbone from the USA saw a picture of a house on the Internet. It was in a small Italian town called Sambuca. There was an auction for the house. Tabbone bid �5,555 - and she got the house! Then, she went to Italy to see her house. According to Tabbone, �5,555 for a house with three bedrooms is a bargain!




The Art Trail of Happiness
World
There is a park called Parr Park in Texas, USA. The park has beautiful tall trees and low hills. It has a trail to walk on with something very special. There are more than 4,000 rocks next to the trail. Why are the rocks special? There is a painting on every rock!
Some of the rocks next to the trail have colorful pictures. Some have just one word, such as "love." There are rocks with paintings of music, sports, movies, and famous people. One rock has a picture of a nurse with the word "Hero." There are animal rocks too. There are happy yellow bees and a cat eating pizza. You can see many different dogs in the "dog park."
People from all over the world paint and send rocks to Parr Park. Some of the people are professional artists. But young children also paint and send rocks to Parr Park. Anyone can do it!  You can paint a rock for the "trail of happiness" too!

The Art Trail of Happiness
World
Parr Park, with its beautiful tall trees and low hills, is a lovely place to hike. Located in Grapevine, Texas, USA, it had very few visitors after the city shut down because of the pandemic. Then, something magical happened. Beautiful hand-painted rocks began to appear along the hiking trail. Suddenly, a walk in the park became an exciting adventure.
There are more than 4,000 rocks by the trail - each a small work of art. Some are very colorful. Some have a one-word message, such as "love" or "faith." There are areas with rocks that share a theme, like music, nature, movie stars, and sports. In the teacher-themed area, a rock with a yellow ruler says "Teachers Rule." Another reads "Best Teacher Ever." In honor of medical workers, there's a nurse wearing a name tag that says "Hero." There's also an animal area with happy yellow bees and a cartoon cat eating pizza. You can find your favorite pet painted on a rock in the "dog park" too.
Where did all these amazing rocks come from? Photographer Ron Olsen put the first rocks by the trail. Then a businessman named Chris Penny added more. The two men began working together to make a special place for the community. "We wanted to make it a getaway for people, and give parents something safe to do outdoors with their children," says Olsen.
Today, hundreds of people visit Parr Park every week. And anyone - from two-year-olds to professional artists - can paint a rock for the trail. Rocks have been sent from all over the USA and abroad. Chris Penny calls the kilometer-long trail "a trail of happiness."

The Art Trail of Happiness
World
Parr Park is a lovely place with a kilometer-long nature trail that passes through tall trees and over gentle hills. The park is located in the city of Grapevine, not far from Dallas, Texas, USA. Although Grapevine is filled with historic buildings, miles of hiking trails, restaurants, and galleries, it almost completely shut down during the pandemic. That is, until Parr Park was turned into a magical wonderland. Today, the nature trail is lined with more than 4,000 hand-painted rocks, and walking the trail is an unforgettable adventure.
Hiking along the trail, visitors encounter rocks and stones - each a work of art. Some blaze with bright colors, while others show a single word, such as "love" or "faith." The many rocks are organized by themes, including music, nature, movie stars, and sports teams, to name a few. There's an image of a nurse wearing a name tag that reads "Hero" in the section honoring health-care workers. There are rocks devoted to teachers with messages such as "Teachers Rule," showing a picture of a yellow ruler, or "Best Teacher Ever," surrounded by delicate flowers. One area is filled with all types of animals - everything from a cartoon cat eating pizza to a family of smiling yellow bees painted on three separate stones. There's even a special "dog park" with pictures of various breeds.
Where did these one-of-a-kind rocks come from? Local photographer Ron Olsen put the original stones along Parr Park's walking trail. When businessman Chris Penny saw them, he added some of his own. Olsen and Penny met, and decided to work together to transform the trail for the community. "We wanted to make it a getaway for people, and give parents something safe to do outdoors with their children," says Olsen. They also hoped it would give people a way to deal with the stress of the pandemic.
Hundreds of people visit the trail every week, and rocks created by anyone who wants to participate - from two-year-olds to professional artists - continue to arrive in Grapevine by mail from the USA and abroad. "It's incredible to see that people from all over are now painting rocks to turn my community into a trail of happiness," says Penny.





Ghana is known for its colorful woven textiles with bold, geometric patterns. But these fabrics are more than just a fashion statement. Each one has a meaning, which is expressed through its colors and designs. The color blue, for example, symbolizes peace, while a zigzag pattern means that life is full of twists and turns. Some textiles represent aspects of Ghanaian history or culture; others tell stories.
Despite the beauty of these fabrics, the country's textile industry has been struggling. In 2004, the government even started a national campaign to encourage people to wear Ghanaian fabrics to support the industry. Then, in 2020, COVID-19 broke out, and the Ghanaian textile industry took another hit.
But a local textile company had an idea. They decided to adapt their designs to the current reality. Only a few months into the COVID crisis, Ghana Textiles Printing (GTP) released a new line of corona-themed fabrics. "We set out to look for ways of telling the story of COVID-19 for generations to come in a positive light," says Stephen Kofi Badu, GTP's marketing director.
GTP's new designs reflect how Ghana's government has been handling the pandemic. For example, one fabric features round eyeglasses floating against a swirling red, white and green background. This is because Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, who has been giving weekly television updates about the coronavirus, wears round eyeglasses. GTP named the fabric Fellow Ghanaians, as Akufo-Addo always begins his updates with those words.
Another design represents the three-week lockdown Ghana endured at the start of the pandemic. It has a repeating pattern of orange padlocks against a background of stripes and circles. It reminds people of when they had to stay home. Another commemorates when borders were closed and no air travel was allowed. This design shows blue airplane propellers arranged around padlocks, surrounded by tiny keys.
 
Recently GTP released a fabric collection called This Too Shall Pass. One of the fabrics in the collection shows eggs in a nest, symbolizing new life. In another design, trees repeat against stripes in shades of brown. One half of the tree has dried, dying branches; the other side has red branches, alive and growing. These natural images represent a hopeful future, after the crisis.

Fabrics That Tell Stories
World
Traditional clothing in Ghana is made of woven cloth with colorful patterns and designs. These designs have deep meanings. Some represent Ghanaian history or culture. Others teach about important qualities, or life lessons. And others tell stories.
Despite the beautiful fabrics, however, business has been bad for Ghana's textile companies for years. Then, when the COVID-19 crisis began, the situation got even worse. But a local textile company, Ghana Textiles Printing (GTP), thought of an idea. They would help business by making new designs inspired by the COVID crisis.
Some of GTP's new designs show what Ghana's government has done during the pandemic. For example, Akufo-Addo, Ghana's president, gave weekly updates on TV at the start of the crisis. Since the president wears round eyeglasses, one of the new fabrics has a pattern with eyeglasses against a red, white and green background. GTP named the fabric Fellow Ghanaians, because Akufo-Addo started each television appearance with these words.
At the start of the pandemic, the government ordered citizens to stay at home for three weeks. So, another design shows a repeating pattern of orange padlocks with stripes and blue circles. During this time, the airports were also closed, so another design has blue airplane propellers around large padlocks and small keys.
 
GTP has also created designs that look toward the future. One new fabric shows eggs in a nest, symbolizing new life. Another design has trees against brown stripes. One side of the tree has unhealthy branches; the other side has red branches, which are alive and growing. These natural images represent the hope of life continuing after the crisis.

Fabrics That Tell Stories
World
Fabric from Ghana has lots of colors and patterns. People make clothing from the fabric. They wear it at special events - like weddings. But special events stopped during COVID-19. And fabric companies needed to get more customers.
The company Ghana Textiles Printing (GTP) had an idea. They made new fabrics. The patterns remind people of the COVID-19 crisis.
Ghana's president is Nana Akufo-Addo. At the start of the crisis, Akufo-Addo spoke on television to the Ghanaian people. So, GTP made a new fabric. The fabric has a pattern with small, round eyeglasses. These are the kind of eyeglasses the president wears. Another fabric has stripes, blue circles and padlocks. This reminds people that they stayed home during the crisis. The government also closed the airports. So GTP made fabric with blue airplane propellers, orange padlocks and small keys.
Now, GTP wants customers to feel hopeful. One new fabric shows eggs in a nest. Another has trees with red branches. What do you think they mean? GTP is looking toward the future, after the crisis.




Happy Happiness Day!
World
Do you live in a "happy country"? The United Nations (UN) can tell you. Every year, the UN makes a list of countries in the world. The first country on the list is the happiest country in the world. The last country on the list isn't a very happy place. The UN thinks happiness is important. That's why they make the list. It's called the World Happiness Report. People in 156 different countries answer questions for the report.
The report shows many things. Rich countries are happier than poor countries. Freedom to make choices is important for happiness. Do you volunteer? According to the report, helping others makes people feel happy.
Finland was the happiest country on the list for three years. Most Finns feel satisfied with their lives. They can depend on their friends and neighbors.
You can read a new World Happiness Report on March 20 every year. Why March 20? That's the UN's "International Day of Happiness." Happy Happiness Day!

Happy Happiness Day!
World
How important is happiness to you? The United Nations (UN) thinks happiness is very important. That's why they made March 20 the UN's International Day of Happiness. Every year, they also publish their World Happiness Report on that day. The report compares how happy people are in 156 different countries around the world.
How does the World Happiness Report get its information? It uses surveys that ask people about how happy they feel. People answer questions about what makes them happy - friends, family, money, the environment, and so on. Included in the report is a list of countries from the happiest to the least happy.
Generally, the report shows that rich countries are happier than poor countries. It also shows that the more control you have over your life, the happier you are. One interesting item from the report shows the importance of helping others. For example, doing volunteer work makes people feel happy. And each report has a theme. In 2018, the theme was how moving to a new country affected happiness. More recently, the theme was where people are happier - in cities or rural areas.
Finland was the happiest country on the UN's list for three years in a row. One reason is that people there feel satisfied with their lives. Another is that they believe that their friends and neighbors will help out when things get difficult. John F. Helliwell is an editor of the World Happiness Report. Helliwell believes happy people "trust each other and care about each other, and that's what fundamentally makes for a better life."

Happy Happiness Day!
World
How important is happiness to you? Many countries believe that their citizens have a right to happiness, and some countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and France, even include the word "happiness" in their constitutions. In 2012, the United Nations (UN) gave happiness its own holiday. Every year, on March 20, the International Day of Happiness celebrates the importance of happiness in the lives of people around the world. And on that same day, the UN releases its World Happiness Report, which measures and compares the happiness of people in 156 different countries.
After surveying people around the world, the World Happiness Report produces a list of countries from most to least happy. According to Professor Jeffrey Sachs, director of the UN office that publishes the report, the survey's questions basically ask people to "imagine that life is a ladder, with the bottom rung being the worst life you can imagine and the top rung being the best life you can imagine." Then, people say where they think they are on the ladder. The report evaluates countries on social, economic and environmental factors that create feelings of happiness. Not surprising perhaps, the report shows that rich countries are happier than poor countries, and freedom to make life choices also increases happiness. Maybe less obvious is that generous people are happier than people who aren't. For example, people who donate to charity or do volunteer work were higher on the happiness scale.
Each yearly report also has a theme. In 2018, the theme was migration - how moving to a new country affected happiness. More recently, the report examined how levels of happiness are different for those living in either cities or rural areas.
Finland was number one on the list for three years in a row. That isn't because Finns smile all the time or express their emotions more. It's because they feel satisfaction with life, and know that they live in a country where they can depend on their fellow citizens during difficult times. As an editor of the World Happiness Report, John F. Helliwell says that happy people "trust each other and care about each other, and that's what fundamentally makes for a better life."





Can you imagine living without electricity? Without electricity, most routine tasks must be finished while there is daylight. However, electricity and other energy sources that provide light can be limited, expensive, and polluting. For almost one billion people in the world who don't have access to electric power, this is their daily reality. But for some people, there's hope. Barefoot College, an organization that is working to bring electricity to rural communities, is training women across the globe to be "Solar Mamas."
What do Solar Mamas do? They learn how to build, install, and maintain solar panels and batteries in order to provide their villages with electricity. The solar panels are used to turn the sun's energy into electricity, which is stored in the batteries. Barefoot College, located in Rajasthan, India, also has training centers in 96 other countries, including Zanzibar, Burkina Faso, and Madagascar. Solar Mamas, most of whom have never left home in their lives, travel as long as 19 hours to a Barefoot College training center, where they live and study for six months. "We actually create an environment where people can find something within themselves, which they never thought they had," says Sanjit "Bunker" Roy, the founder and director of Barefoot College. 
Instructors and students, who come from all over the world, often don't even speak the same language. In addition, many of the women who become Solar Mamas are illiterate. Instructors communicate with sign language and teach in a very creative way, which one instructor calls "learning by doing, doing by learning." They rely mostly on pictures, color-coded charts, and demonstrations. Students who can't read or write learn through listening and memorizing. When they finish studying, the Solar Mamas return to their villages to set up the solar power system, bringing a renewable energy source to their communities.
So far, more than 750 Solar Mamas serving 1,300 villages worldwide, have been trained by Barefoot College, and more training centers are being developed. Florentina Choc, a proud Solar Mama from Belize, says that after she returned home, "Something changed in the village, not like before when we stayed in the dark. Now, my village has light."

Solar Mamas
World
Almost one billion people in the world live without electricity. Most of them live in villages and small communities in developing countries. Because they don't have electricity to make light, these people work during the day. An organization called Barefoot College wants to help bring electricity to these communities. At Barefoot College, women learn how to build solar panels. With solar panels, they can collect energy from the sun and use it to make electricity for their communities. These women are called "Solar Mamas."
There are Barefoot College centers in more than 90 countries around the world. Solar Mamas travel to the nearest center to take a special six-month course in how to build solar panels. Most of these Solar Mamas have never left home before, but they travel long distances to go to Barefoot College. It can take them as long as 19 hours to get there!  
Teachers and students at Barefoot College come from many different countries. They often don't even speak the same language. Another problem is that many Solar Mamas don't know how to read or write. So, Solar Mamas must learn about solar energy in an unusual way. Teachers use sign language, charts, and a lot of pictures. They give demonstrations, too. Students learn by listening and memorizing. Then, the Solar Mamas return home to build solar panels in their communities.
So far, Barefoot College has trained more than 750 Solar Mamas. Florentina Choc is a proud Solar Mama from Belize. Choc says that after she returned home,"Something changed in the village, not like before when we stayed in the dark. Now, my village has light."

Solar Mamas
World
We use electricity every day. But about one billion people in the world don't have electricity. This makes their lives very hard. But they can get help at Barefoot College. It is a special school. Women learn how to build solar panels at Barefoot College. They learn how to get energy from the sun and make electricity. These women are called "Solar Mamas."
Solar Mamas are from villages all over the world. They come to Barefoot College centers. There are Barefoot College centers in more than 90 countries. Many Solar Mamas can't read or write. How do they learn to build solar panels? The teachers use a lot of pictures. They show the students what to do. Students must memorize a lot of information. Students study for six months. They go back to their villages. They build solar panels. Then, their villages have electricity!
Florentina Choc is a proud Solar Mama from Belize. Choc says, "Something changed in the village, not like before when we stayed in the dark. Now, my village has light."

A group of tourists walks down a dirt path through a forest in Tlaxcala, Mexico. As night falls, tiny dots of light appear. One by one, they flash among the trees until the forest comes alive with thousands of blinking lights. "It's almost like your eyes are playing tricks on you," one tourist says. He speaks quietly so he doesn't disturb the stars of the show - fireflies that live in this pine forest around 75 kilometers east of Mexico City.
The fireflies (actually beetles, not flies) live in this forest year round, and their mating season is from the end of June to the beginning of August. Female fireflies can't fly well, so they stay close to the ground. Each night from 8:30 to 9:30 during the mating season, the forest comes alive with light, as females flash their tails, attracting male fireflies - and plenty of tourists.
Tourists started coming to Nanacamilpa village in Tlaxcala in the 1990s. A rural cooperative called Piedra Canteada decided to supplement its logging business by opening up campsites for tourists. Then, in 2011, Piedra Canteada decided to capitalize on the magical fireflies. Suddenly, tourism was booming as thousands of eco-tourists flocked to the forest of more than six square kilometers. "One day we were a ghost town, and the next one, we were the most visited town in the state," says Nanacamilpa's mayor, V�ctor Hugo S�nchez Flores. New hotels and restaurants were built all over the village to accommodate more than 50,000 yearly visitors.
However, some people worry that the flood of tourists could hurt the insects. Because the females stay close to the ground, tourists might crush them with their feet. Tourists also bring artificial light (from cell phones, for example) which can interfere with the mating process. Prohibiting cell phones and flashlights, limiting the number of weekend visitors, and planting new trees are helping the fireflies survive. Additionally, researchers at the University of Chapingo are studying the fireflies to determine the best way to preserve the population.
"I couldn't believe the show we saw tonight," raved one visitor. Hopefully, the fireflies will continue to light up the forest far into the future.

Nature's Light Show
World
In Tlaxcala, Mexico, a group of tourists walks through a forest filled with thousands of tiny, blinking lights. "It's almost like your eyes are playing tricks on you," says one tourist. But it's no trick. The lights come from fireflies (which are actually beetles). Their mating season is from the end of June to the beginning of August. Each night of the mating season, from 8:30 to 9:30, the forest is filled with females lighting up to attract males.
Tourism in this area of Central Mexico started in the 1990s. A company called Piedra Canteada opened campsites for tourists near the Nanacamilpa village. Then, in 2011, Piedra Canteada started bringing tourists to watch the magical fireflies. Suddenly, tourism was booming. There are more than 50,000 visitors each year. "One day we were a ghost town, and the next one, we were the most visited town in the state," says V�ctor Hugo S�nchez Flores, Nanacamilpa's mayor.
However, some people worry that having too many tourists could harm the insects. Female fireflies can't fly well, so they stay close to the ground. This puts them in danger of being stepped on by tourists. Tourists also bring artificial light - from cell phones, for example - into the forests. This light can confuse the males during mating. Banning cell phones and flashlights, as well as limiting the number of weekend visitors, are helping to protect the fireflies. Additionally, researchers have been studying the fireflies to find the best way to preserve them. Hopefully, the fireflies will continue to light up the forest far into the future.

Nature's Light Show
World
There is a forest in Tlaxcala, Mexico. Thousands of fireflies live there. Fireflies are not actually flies. They're beetles.
Female fireflies shine a bright light from their tails. They shine the light to attract males for mating. So, the females only light up during mating season, in July. And they only light up for one hour each night. Visit the forest from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. any night in July. You'll see a forest full of blinking lights.
In 2011, tourists started coming to see the fireflies in Tlaxcala. Today, more than 50,000 visitors come each year to enjoy the light show. But some people worry about the tourists. Will they hurt the fireflies? Female fireflies can't fly well; they stay close to the ground. Tourists may step on them. Tourists also have cell phones and flashlights. These bring artificial light. The male fireflies think the artificial lights are females.
Scientists are trying to find ways to keep the fireflies safe. After all, the fireflies are the stars of the show!





Many cities in the world have winter festivals. In Oaxaca (wuh-HAH-kuh), Mexico, people celebrate Noche de R�banos. This means "Night of the Radishes". The festival is in December. The main event of the festival is a radish contest. People carve radishes to make sculptures!
Before the festival, the city plants radishes in special gardens. The radishes get very big. Some radishes weigh two kilograms. Some are 50 centimeters long.
Four days before the festival, contestants collect their radishes. They have three days to carve their radishes into different shapes, like people and animals. On December 23, contestants show their sculptures in Oaxaca's main square. Thousands of visitors walk around. They look at the amazing creations. Judges walk around, too. They choose the best sculpture. The winner gets 30,000 pesos (around $1,500 dollars).
Fernando Lopez was a contestant in Noche de R�banos. He said, "It feels great to see so many people come and see our artwork."

Night of the Radishes
World
It's a December evening, and thousands of people are standing in line in the central square of Oaxaca (wuh-HAH-kuh), Mexico. Everyone's here for a unique festival with sculptures made of giant radishes. It's time for Noche de R�banos, or Night of the Radishes.
Years ago, at Oaxaca's annual Christmas marketplace, farmers wanted to attract customers to their vegetable stalls. So, they would carve radish sculptures and display them at their stalls. Then, in 1897, Oaxaca's mayor, Francisco Vasconcelos, turned the radish-carving tradition into a yearly competition to be held each year on December 23.
Night of the Radishes has two categories for competitors. In the "free" category, they can carve anything they choose. In the "traditional" category, sculptures must relate to Oaxacan culture. The winning prize is 30,000 pesos, around $1,500 dollars. To hold their sculptures together, sculptors can only use wooden toothpicks and string.
Radishes are grown specifically for the competition. The radishes are planted in government-owned gardens. They are grown in a special way, so they have interesting shapes. The radishes are also very large. Some are as heavy as two kilograms, and longer than 50 centimeters! Four days before the festival, competitors pick their radishes. They then have three days to create their sculptures.
Finally, on December 23, stalls with incredible radish sculptures fill the square. Visitors and judges walk among the stalls looking over the creations. "It is something really beautiful," says competitor Fernando Lopez. "It feels great to see so many people come and see our artwork, that we create with so much care."

It's a December evening, and a long line of spectators winds around the central plaza in the city of Oaxaca (wuh-HAH-kuh), Mexico. Thousands of people are here for a unique celebration - a radish-carving festival, where competitors proudly display sculptures they carved out of giant radishes. It's time for Noche de R�banos, or Night of the Radishes.
Radishes were first brought to Mexico in the 16th century. Over the years, a local tradition developed at Oaxaca's annual Christmas marketplace. There, farmers would carve eye-catching displays of radishes to attract customers to their vegetable stalls. After the festival, the sculptures were used as centerpieces, decorating holiday tables. In 1897, Oaxaca's mayor, Francisco Vasconcelos, made the tradition official, and announced a radish-carving competition to be held each year on December 23.
Night of the Radishes has two categories for competitors. In the "free" category, they can carve anything they choose. In the more popular, "traditional" category, sculptures must relate to Oaxacan culture. The winning prize is 30,000 pesos, approximately $1,500 dollars. To build their radish masterpieces, competitors may only use organic materials - other vegetable material, wooden toothpicks, and string.
Competitors use radishes grown specifically for Noche de R�banos. They are planted in government-owned plots of land, and specially cultivated to be unusually-shaped and huge. Some are as heavy as two kilograms, and more than 50 centimeters long. Four days before the festival, participants harvest the radishes (approximately 10 tons of radishes are harvested each year!). Then, they have three days to prepare and carve their sculptures.
Finally, on December 23, the plaza is filled with stalls displaying the final works of art. Visitors and judges walk among the stalls observing the incredible creations. Competitors must keep their sculptures moist in the sun, constantly spraying them with water to keep them from wilting or turning brown.
Making the intricate sculptures takes patience, skill, and creativity. "We want people to see what we want to express through the radishes," says competitor Fernando Lopez. "It is something really beautiful. It feels great to see so many people come and see our artwork, that we create with so much care."




The Sweetest Art
World
A tourist in Japan holds up a wooden stick with a small, colorful sculpture on top. "Does this look like me?" he asks. The unique sculpture, which looks just like the tourist, is edible! It was created by Takahiro Yoshihara, an artist who practices amezaiku � traditional Japanese candy making.
Amezaiku, which means "candy craft", has been around for more than a thousand years. Brought to Japan from China in ancient times, the candy was originally used in religious ceremonies. Later, amezaiku evolved into a type of street performance with music and storytelling as part of the experience. In those days, amezaiku makers were peddlers traveling from town to town selling their treats. For hundreds of years, amezaiku artists performed at festivals, delighting both Japanese children and adults.
Today, amezaiku candy is made the same way as it was years ago with thick, hot, sugar syrup called mizuame. To begin, a ball of mizuame, which has been heated to 80 degrees Celsius, is put on the end of a wooden stick. "You do burn yourself when you first start making amezaiku," says Yoshihara, "but eventually, of course, your hands get used to it." Then, using his fingers and special candy scissors, the artist pulls and cuts the candy, transforming the ball into animals, flowers, and mythical creatures, such as dragons and winged horses. Artists have just five minutes to work, as the candy quickly starts to cool and harden. Finally, details like eyes, stripes, and shading are painted on with edible dyes. The completed lollipop is wrapped in plastic, and can stay fresh up to three weeks.  
Over the years, amezaiku has become less common in Japan. Today, only a handful of trained amezaiku artists remain. Like Yoshihara, Shinri Tezuka is keeping this ancient art alive in the 21st century. Tezuka runs amezaiku workshops out of his two stores in Tokyo, Japan. "I want to preserve this culture, so my shop and techniques will still be around in one thousand years," says Tezuka. And Yoshihara, who opened Japan's first amezaiku shop in 2008, wants customers to appreciate and have fun with his art. "But at the end of the day," he tells them, "I hope you find it delicious!"

"Does this look like me?" asks a tourist in Japan, holding a small, colorful lollipop next to his face. The lollipop looks just like the tourist! It was created by Takahiro Yoshihara, an artist who does amezaiku � traditional Japanese candy making.
Amezaiku has been around for more than one thousand years. It was first used in religious ceremonies. Later, candy makers added music and stories to entertain crowds while making the candy, and amezaiku became more like a performance. In those days, amezaiku artists didn't have their own shops. Instead, they traveled from town to town, selling their treats at festivals and other crowded places.
Today, amezaiku candy is made the same way as it was many years ago. Amezaiku starts as mizuame, a thick, hot, sugar syrup heated to 80 degrees Celsius. A ball of mizuame is put on the end of a wooden stick. Using only fingers and special candy scissors, the artist pulls and cuts the candy. Artists have to work very quickly because the candy starts to cool and harden within five minutes. The mizuame is shaped into flowers, animals, and other creatures, such as dragons and winged horses. Details are painted on with edible dye, and the artist wraps the lollipop in clear plastic.
Over the years, amezaiku has become less common in Japan. Yoshihara is one of only a handful of trained amezaiku artists working today. He opened Japan's first amezaiku shop in 2008, keeping this traditional art alive in the 21st century. Yoshihara wants customers to appreciate and have fun with his art. "But at the end of the day," he tells them, "I hope you find it delicious!"

Do you like candy? In Japan, people enjoy colorful lollipops called amezaiku. Special candy artists make them.
Amezaiku came to Japan from China hundreds of years ago. Amezaiku artists traveled from town to town in Japan to sell their candy. They went to festivals and other crowded places. Artists made the candy, and they also told stories and played music. People enjoyed the stories and songs. They loved eating the beautiful candy, too.  
 
Takahiro Yoshihara is a candy artist in Japan today. In 2008, he opened Japan's first amezaiku shop. You can buy many kinds of amezaiku animals, flowers, and other objects there. How does Yoshihara make amezaiku? First, he takes a ball of hot sugar syrup. Yoshihara puts the ball on a wooden stick. Then, he uses his fingers and scissors to make an animal or a flower. Yoshihara must work quickly � the syrup gets hard in five minutes! Finally, he paints the candy with a special dye. "I hope you find it delicious!" Yoshihara says.




Bosai Girls to the Rescue!
World
Japan has a lot of earthquakes and tsunamis. People must be ready for these natural disasters. But many young people in Japan don't prepare for these disasters. They think it's hard and not interesting. Misaki Tanaka has a solution. She started the organization Bosai Girls. The organization encourages young people to get ready for natural disasters. They do this by making preparing for a disaster more interesting.
For example, Bosai Girls makes boring evacuation drills "fun". How? People pretend there is an earthquake. Then, they compete to see who can get to safe places first. It's a game, and you use a smartphone app to play!
Bosai Girls also has special accessories, which help people during natural disasters. The accessories are fashionable. There are boots, and bags with maps. There are also special bracelets. People can use the bracelets ten different ways - even as a whistle or a tourniquet.
Many people come to Bosai Girls' activities. In the future Tanaka hopes to help people prepare for disasters all over the world.

Bosai Girls to the Rescue!
World
Japan is in an area where there are many earthquakes. The earthquake and following tsunami in 2011, was the worst in Japan's history. A young Japanese woman named Misaki Tanaka was deeply affected by this tragedy. In order to raise awareness about how to be prepared for natural disasters, she started an organization called Bosai Girls.
Bosai Girls means "girls take action to prevent disaster". Tanaka started the organization's website in 2013 to help Japan's citizens (especially millennials and women) to be better prepared for disasters. Bosai Girls holds events like "next-generation" evacuation drills. Using a special smartphone app, people compete to find the most evacuation centers in a particular area in a certain amount of time. Tanaka says making drills like games makes them more enjoyable.
Bosai Girls' tsunami awareness campaign is called #beORANGE. When people in coastal areas see bright orange flags, they know to immediately run to higher ground. So far, Bosai Girls has given around 400 orange flags to cities and towns all over Japan. Bosai Girls even use orange in their special rope bracelet which can be used in more than ten different ways during a crisis - including as a whistle or tourniquet. The bracelet is part of an accessories collection which has shoes that can be folded, bags covered with maps, and lightweight boots. Tanaka believes these fashionable accessories are more appealing to millennials than the usual disaster products.
Bosai Girls seems to be succeeding - more than 3,000 people come to their events, and some say Bosai Girls has "changed their lives". In the future, Tanaka wants to increase disaster preparedness around the world. Bosai Girls to the rescue!

Bosai Girls to the Rescue!
World
Japan is located in a region of the Pacific Ocean where a large number of the world's earthquakes occur. In 2011, the biggest earthquake in Japan's history, followed by a massive tsunami, caused major destruction. Out of the rubble of this natural disaster, Bosai Girls was born.
Bosai Girls founder, Misaki Tanaka, was deeply affected by the 2011 disaster. So, in August 2013, she started the Bosai Girls website to spread the word about disaster preparedness to Japan's citizens. Tanaka's creative approach especially targets millennials and women. "Bosai" means "disaster prevention" in Japanese, so Bosai Girls means "girls take action to prevent disaster".
Among the activities that Bosai Girls sponsor, are what Tanaka calls "next-generation" evacuation drills. These drills are run in trendy Tokyo neighborhoods where young people spend time. Using a special smartphone app, participants compete with each other to try to find as many evacuation centers as possible during a set period of time. The game element helps simulate the difficult experience of navigating a city during a disaster, making the drills more exciting than conventional drills.
Bosai Girls has also launched a tsunami awareness campaign called #beORANGE. When a tsunami warning siren goes off, bright orange flags are raised at evacuation centers so those in coastal areas know they must immediately run to safer, higher ground. So far, the group has given around 400 orange flags to cities and towns all over Japan. As part of the campaign, Bosai Girls even incorporated the color orange into a rope bracelet, called a "misanga". The bracelet can be used in more than ten different ways during a crisis - including as a whistle or a tourniquet. The misanga is part of the Bosai Girls' disaster accessories collection, which are practical yet fashionable products. The collection includes sturdy foldable shoes, bags covered with 3D maps of a popular district in Tokyo, and lightweight boots for disaster relief volunteers. Tanaka believes that people may be more likely to use "disaster chic" accessories than traditional, less stylish products.
Bosai Girls seems to be having an impact. Their events bring more than 3,000 attendees, and some say Bosai Girls has "changed their lives". In the future, Tanaka wants to continue increasing disaster preparedness globally. Bosai Girls to the rescue!




Making Black-and-White Photos Come Alive
World
There is something very powerful about old black-and-white photographs. They bring us to a different time and place. Yet, since we live in a world of color, black-and-white photos don't have the same authentic feel as color photos. When we look at people in black-and-white photos, they don't seem quite real; we don't feel a connection to them as we do with people in color photos.

Now, however, colorization artists are working to change this. They are adding color to historic black-and-white photos to make them come alive. "By introducing color, it helps to make it feel like it is a real piece of the past we can connect to," says colorization artist Dana Keller, from Boston, USA.

Jordan J. Lloyd, a colorization artist in London, England, speaks of an additional benefit to colorization. He explains that adding color to black-and-white photos helps viewers see old images in new ways. When there's no color, they look at the entire picture as a whole. Once color is added, viewers start noticing interesting details they might not have noticed before.

Colorization artists color photos digitally, using photo-editing software. But they don't just choose any colors. They do hours and hours of research to find out which colors are historically accurate. They look through old diaries, government records, museum artifacts, and old advertisements. They speak with history experts. 

To colorize an old photo, artists first restore the photo by fixing its cracks and scratches. Next, they add many layers of color and blend them together. "Nothing is just one color," explains Keller. (Skin, for example, can be made up of 20 different colors.) Finally, the artists adjust the colors based on how they are affected by light; they pay attention to shadows, weather conditions, and types of lighting.

Some people don't like what colorization artists are doing. They say the artists are changing, and even destroying, history. But Lloyd explains that a colorized photo is not meant to replace the original. "It sits alongside the original, but it's not a substitute." He believes that the two photos work together to tell a complete story.

Making Black-and-White Photos Come Alive
World
We live in a world of color. That's why black-and-white photos often seem strange to us, and the people in the photos don't seem real.

Photo colorization artists are trying to change this. They're adding color to black-and-white photos, to make the subjects come alive. Colorization artist Dana Keller says that colorizing a photo helps make the photo feel like it's "a real piece of the past we can connect to."

Colorization artists use a computer and special software to colorize the photos. But before they start, they need to know which colors to use. What was the color of a subject's hair, for example, or clothing? To find out what the real colors were, the artists do research. They look at diaries, objects in museums, and old ads. They speak with experts in history.

Next, the colorization artists fix the old photos by getting rid of scratches. Then, it's time to add the colors. To make each color look just right, the artists mix many different colors together. Finally, the artists look at the lighting in the pictures and make small changes. If there is a shadow, for example, the artist will make a color darker.

Some people don't want artists to colorize photos. They say it changes history. But colorization artist Jordan J. Lloyd says that colorized photos aren't supposed to replace black-and-white photos. He wants us to look at both types of photos together. This will give us a more complete picture of history, and make the subjects in the photos feel more real.

Making Black-and-White Photos Come Alive
World
Look at old black-and-white photos. Do the people in the photos look real to you? Or do they look like they're from a different world? People in black-and-white photos sometimes seem strange to us. This is because our world is full of color.

Some artists are trying to make old black-and-white photos come alive. They are adding color to the photos, using a computer.

The artists research the true colors of the people and objects in a photo. Then they add these colors to the photos. If a house was yellow, they make the house yellow. To research, the artists read diaries. They go to museums. They speak to historians. 

Some people worry that color photos will replace black-and-white photos. But artist Jordan Lloyd disagrees. Lloyd adds color to black-and-white photos. But he wants people to look at the color and black-and-white photos together. He thinks that will make history really come alive.





It isn't easy to get people to recycle. But a new project in Amsterdam, Holland, might change that. The project is called WASTED. When you recycle with WASTED, you get free products and other rewards.

How does WASTED work? First, you make an account on the WASTED Web site. WASTED digital "coins" go into this account. You put the items you want to recycle, such as plastic bottles and newspapers, in special WASTED bags. When a bag is full, you take it to a recycling container. There, you upload a photograph of the full bag to the WASTED Web site. Then, you throw the bag into the container. After you do this, you get one digital "coin". You get one coin for each full WASTED bag.

You can use your WASTED coins at more than 70 Amsterdam businesses. For example, with one coin you can get a free ice cream. You can also save money on services, like fixing your bike. WASTED is a great way to get people to recycle, and a great way to help the environment.

Getting people to recycle isn't easy. But a new project in Amsterdam, Holland, is making it easier. The project is called WASTED. It encourages people to recycle by rewarding them with free products or discounts.

How does WASTED work? First, you go to the WASTED Web site and you create a WASTED account. After creating your account, you receive 12 WASTED trash bags in the mail. These bags are for separating plastic, paper, and textiles. When a bag is full of items to recycle, you take it to the nearest recycling container. Before you throw the bag into the container, you scan a code on the bag with your smartphone. Then you upload a photograph of the full bag to the WASTED Web site. When the Web site receives this information, it puts one digital "coin" into your WASTED account. Each full WASTED bag earns you another coin.

More than 70 Amsterdam businesses accept WASTED digital coins. These businesses offer different types of rewards and discounts. For example, one WASTED digital coin can get you a free coffee or a 50% discount on bike tire repair. Thanks to the WASTED project, businesses get attention for helping the environment. This brings in new customers. Not surprisingly, new businesses are always joining the project.

WASTED has had a big effect on its participants. Almost all project users said that WASTED made them notice how much plastic they use, and 52% are now separating their plastic because of WASTED. WASTED has created a new way to get people to recycle. That's a big win for the environment.

Getting people to recycle isn't always easy, and many recycling projects fail. But a project in Amsterdam, Holland, seems to be succeeding. The project is called WASTED, and it encourages people to recycle by rewarding them with free products, or discounts at local businesses.

How does WASTED work? You simply go to the WASTED Web site and create an account. After creating your account, you receive 12 special WASTED trash bags in the mail for separating plastic, paper, and textiles. Each bag has a code printed on it, which allows the WASTED team to keep track of your recycling. When a bag is full of items to recycle, you just take it to the nearest recycling container. Before you throw the bag into the container, you scan the code on the bag with your smartphone. Then you upload a photograph of the full bag to the WASTED Web site. One digital "coin" is then deposited into your WASTED account. Each bagful earns you another digital coin. New WASTED trash bags are sent to your home for every five coins you earn.

WASTED digital coins can be used at more than 70 Amsterdam businesses. These businesses offer different types of rewards and discounts. For example, one WASTED digital coin can get you a free coffee, tea, or scoop of ice cream, a 50% discount on bike tire repair, or a 25% discount on fruits and vegetables. You can also get a discount on yoga lessons. By participating in WASTED, businesses get good publicity for helping the environment, which brings them new customers. In this way, WASTED has strengthened the connection between the people of Amsterdam and local businesses. Not surprisingly, new businesses are constantly joining the project.

A survey about the project found that 52% of project participants are now separating their plastic because of WASTED, and 23% have started buying fewer products packaged in plastic. Almost all participants said that WASTED made them more aware of how much plastic they use. By giving value to trash, WASTED has created a clever way to encourage people to recycle, and that's a big win for the environment.




How Free is "Free"?
Business
Have you ever accepted a free sample of cheese (or another food) at a supermarket? The supermarket hopes that if you like the cheese, you'll buy a whole package of it. And if it wasn't tasty? Many customers buy it anyway, even if they don't really want it! "You feel obligated to some degree," explains Professor Dan Ariely, "... [making] it more likely you buy the full package." Ariely researches behavioral economics at Duke University in North Carolina, USA. Ariely studies how and why people make decisions. He says getting an unexpected gift makes people extremely happy. This feeling of joy can make them act irrationally, however. When people have the chance to get something for free, they don't always see the downsides.
Giving away samples is just one way companies use "free" to sell products. Another way is BOGO (Buy One, Get One). Let's say you want to buy a pair of shoes. The company offers you a second pair for "free." But companies don't want to lose money, so they raise the price of the shoes in advance. And your great BOGO deal, is not so great after all.
Ads with the word "free" are all over the Internet. Many streaming services offer customers one free month of service when they pay for a subscription. If customers cancel their subscription by the end of the month, they won't be charged. Many people subscribe thinking they'll get a month of service for free, and then they'll cancel the subscription, so they won't have to pay. However, they often forget to cancel, and get charged for the service each month. So, again, the company makes money.
There are also "free" versions of gaming apps. Companies create a free, basic version of their game to encourage people to play. Then, they offer players extra features to enhance the game. Of course, these extra features cost money.
Finally, almost every "freebie" requires personal details from a customer, such as an e-mail address, so the company can send customers ads for other products. When a product is free, there's almost always a "catch." So, the next time you see an ad for a "free" product or service, think about whether or not it's actually worth it!

How Free is "Free"?

Do you like getting free food samples? Supermarkets give out samples to encourage customers to try (and hopefully buy) new products. And if the sample isn't tasty? Many customers buy it anyway! Professor Dan Ariely (from Duke University in North Carolina, USA) studied the reason for this. He explains that the surprise of getting something for "free" makes people so happy they stop thinking clearly. Then, they make irrational decisions.
Giving away samples is just one way that companies use "free" to sell products. Another way is BOGO (Buy One, Get One). Let's say you want to buy a pair of shoes. The company offers you a second pair for "free." But companies don't want to lose money, so they raise the price of the shoes in advance. While you think you're getting a great deal, you're actually paying regular prices.
Has a company ever offered to let you try their product for free? Many streaming services offer customers one month of free service when they sign up. Many customers sign up, planning to cancel their subscription by the end of the month. They often forget to cancel, however, and they end up paying each month. Streaming services know this, which is why they have the deal.
"Free" is also used by gaming apps. You can play the game for free. But there are extra features that make the game more exciting. Of course, these features cost money.
So, the next time you see an ad for a "free" product, remember to look for hidden costs or drawbacks, because "free" doesn't always mean free!

How Free is "Free"?
Business
People like to get free things. Companies like to give free things. Giving free things is good for companies. Companies make money. But are they good for customers?
Sometimes supermarkets give customers free food samples. If customers like the sample, they may buy the food. Even people who don't like the sample sometimes buy the food! Researcher Dan Ariely tells why. He says "free" makes us very happy. Then, we don't think clearly. We buy things we don't really want.
People enjoy free games on their phones. To make the games more fun, you can get extra features. These extra features cost money.
A streaming service lets people watch television and movies online. Many streaming services let you watch for free for one month. Many people sign up to watch for free. Then they plan to cancel, so they won't have to pay. But they forget to cancel, and they pay for the service.
Why do companies give you free things? "Free" makes customers spend money!





Many restaurants do food delivery. Delivery people bring food to people's homes. But now, there is a new kind of food delivery. Flying robots called "drones" bring you food! There is no pilot in a drone. A person on the ground uses a device to make the drone fly.
How does drone delivery work? First, you order your meal through an app. Then, the restaurant makes the food. Next, workers put the food inside a special box under the drone. Then, the drone flies to your house. But it doesn't land. The drone stays in the air. It sends the food down slowly, using a wire. The wire puts the bag of food down on the ground.
Delivery people travel by scooter, bicycle, or car. Sometimes there is traffic on the roads. Then, delivery people have to go slowly. But drones fly above the ground. There is no traffic! Also, cars make the air dirty. Drones are better for the environment.
In the future, maybe all restaurants will use delivery drones.

The Fastest Food
Business
A bag containing Joe Duwors' dinner just landed in his yard! "That's pretty cool," says Duwors of North Carolina, USA. Earlier, Duwors had used an app to order takeout from a local restaurant. But instead of being brought by a delivery person, Duwors' meal was brought by an autonomous flying drone! Drones are small flying vehicles with propellers. A person on the ground drives the drone using remote control.
Duwors' delivery came from Flytrex, the company that makes the drones. Each drone has a special box to hold the food. It can carry up to three kilograms. When the drone arrives at a customer's yard, doors on the bottom of the box open. The drone stays in the air, and uses a wire to carefully lower the bag of food to the ground.
There are advantages to using delivery drones. Traditional food delivery relies on vehicles, such as cars, scooters and bicycles. But these vehicles need to deal with traffic and other delays on the roads. Drones, however, fly about 60 meters above the ground. And drones don't create air pollution - like cars do - so they're more eco-friendly.
Restaurants like drone delivery because drones can make more deliveries per hour than humans. But that means fewer delivery jobs for people, which is why not everyone likes the idea of drone delivery. Also, cooks will have to work much more quickly to keep up with the drones. This may create dangerous working conditions.
The drone delivery industry continues to develop, however. So, keep checking the sky, as more and more drones will be bringing food to happy customers like Duwors!

Joe Duwors of North Carolina, USA, walks into his backyard, picks up a bag of food, and carries it into his house. "That's pretty cool," he says. Duwors' dinner has come from the sky!
Duwors received his food delivery from a local restaurant. But instead of it coming with a delivery person, it was dropped off by an autonomous flying drone. Drones are small vehicles with propellers, flown via remote control. The drone company Flytrex was responsible for Duwors' delivery. Flytrex works with US restaurant companies, serving thousands of customers in North Carolina, North Dakota, and California - and they're continuing to expand.
To get a drone food delivery, you place an order through an app. The food arrives in about 30 minutes. Each drone has a special box attached to it to hold the food. It can carry up to three kilograms, travels at about 51 kilometers per hour, and can fly approximately eight kilometers roundtrip. Upon arrival, doors on the bottom of the box open. Then, a bag of food, attached to a wire, is lowered into the customer's yard.
Traditional food delivery vehicles need to deal with traffic and other delays. But drones avoid traffic by flying about 60 meters above the ground. Delivery drones are also "greener" than conventional delivery methods. Unlike cars, drones don't create air pollution. Using drones can also help companies save money. Instead of hiring multiple delivery drivers, for example, one employee can control many drones.
But not everyone agrees that drone delivery is a good idea. Using drones means fewer delivery jobs for humans. A person can make between 2-4 deliveries per hour, while Flytrex drones can make up to 10! That also means the people cooking and preparing the food orders have to work much more quickly. And most food companies aren't increasing their number of employees or raising workers' salaries for these working conditions.
Restaurants and food companies, however, are excited about the developing industry. For now, Flytrex is one of a handful of companies offering the drone delivery service. But the industry is expected to expand quickly, with more and more drones taking to the skies, bringing food to happy customers like Duwors.




Don't Waste Food - Upcycle It!
Business
Squeeze about three oranges and you'll have a delicious glass of fresh juice. And what happens to the peels? Do they go into the garbage? Most of this food waste ends up in landfills. But now, it can be "upcycled."
Upcycling takes food leftovers that would be thrown away and uses them for the ingredients to create something new. For example, when manufacturing soy milk, coffee, or other beverages, there is organic material left over. Instead of getting rid of this material, food companies are upcycling it into snack bars, chips, cookies, and crackers. Imperfect fruits and vegetables grown by farmers provide another source of ingredients for upcycling. Grocery stores and supermarkets can't sell these "ugly" or strange-looking products, so farmers simply throw them away. But there's no need to do that anymore.
Upcycling is one of the year's biggest food business trends, with an estimated worth of $46.7 billion. Yet, despite the fact that business is booming, many people have never heard of upcycled food! A recent study found that eight in ten people would actively seek out upcycled food if they knew it were available. "Unfortunately, only 10% of consumers are familiar with upcycled food products," says Leah Graham, of the Upcycled Food Association (UFA) in the USA.
Founded in 2019, UFA lets consumers know about food upcycling. UFA has even developed a special food label. This label helps customers find the more than 400 upcycled products already available in stores. According to Graham, the special label also increases awareness of upcycled food and appeals to environmentally responsible customers.
In fact, food waste is a huge environmental issue. It takes energy and water to grow, transport, and package food - all wasted when it's thrown away. Food is also the biggest contributor to landfills. And as it rots, food makes methane, a harmful greenhouse gas that is a cause of global warming. Upcycling food keeps tons of food out of landfills.
Not only is upcycled food good for business and good for the environment, it's also good for you! Upcycled ingredients are used to make healthy products such as Renewal Mill's oat flour. One cup has much more protein than regular white flour!
So, are you ready to try upcycled food?

After you make a glass of orange juice, what happens to the peels? Most of them end up in landfills. But now, a lot of food waste gets "upcycled."
Upcycling is a way of using leftover food as ingredients to create something new. For example, companies that make soy milk and other drinks have a lot of leftover organic material. They use it to make chips, cookies, crackers, and other snacks. Supermarkets can't sell "ugly" fruit and vegetables, but they don't need to throw them away anymore.  Upcycling solves that problem!
Although the upcycling business is worth around $46.7 billion, only 10% of consumers know about it!
According to a recent study, however, eight in ten people would like to buy upcycled food - they just can't find it in stores. That's where the Upcycled Food Association (UFA) in the USA comes in.
There are already more than 400 upcycled food products, and the UFA helps consumers find them. The UFA made a special food label so the products are easy to locate. The label also tells consumers that a food company cares about protecting the environment.
Actually, food waste is a big problem for the environment. We need more and more landfills for all the waste. And the food in landfills makes a harmful greenhouse gas called methane. This gas adds to global warming. With upcycling, less food goes into landfills.
Upcycled food is also good for you! Companies turn upcycled ingredients into healthy products. For example, a company called Renewal Mill makes oat flour from upcycled ingredients. Oat flour is much healthier than regular white flour.

When a company makes orange juice, people buy the juice. But, what happens to the peels? The peels become garbage, or food waste. This food waste goes to landfills. It fills up one landfill, then another, then another. And that is very bad for the environment.
Today, food waste doesn't all go to landfills. Some companies "upcycle" food waste. That means they make something good from the waste. For example, some companies make cookies and crackers from food waste. These new upcycled foods are good for you. And they taste good too!
But there's more! Upcycling is big business! It is worth $46.7 billion! But there is one problem. Sometimes, it's hard to find upcycled foods in a store or market. So now, there's a special label for upcycled foods. The label makes it easy to find them.
There are more than 400 different types of upcycled foods. Do you want to try some?





The Empire State Building in New York City is one of the most famous buildings in the world. It is 102 floors high. From its beginning in 1931 until 1970, it was the tallest building in the world.
A company called Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) owns the Empire State Building. ESRT wanted to save money. They also wanted the Empire State Building to be "green." First, they changed all 6,514 of the windows in the building. The new windows help save energy. Then, ESRT changed over to wind power for the building's electricity. ESRT also owns thirteen other office buildings. Today, all of their buildings use wind power.
Wind power will save a lot of money and energy for ESRT. New York City has thousands of taxis. Imagine that all of the taxis stay off the streets for a year. That's now much energy wind power will save! ESRT will save about $800,000 every year from wind power. And New York City will have less pollution. That's good news and good business!

The Empire State Building - It's Good Business!

The Empire State Building in New York City is one of the most famous buildings in the world. Standing 102 floors high, it was finished in 1931, and was the world's tallest building for almost 40 years. Today, tourists ride the elevator to the 86th floor to enjoy amazing 360� views of the city.
The Empire State Building is owned by Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT). About ten years ago, ESRT took a first step to improve energy efficiency in the almost 100-year-old building. They replaced the windows with special windows that save energy - all 6,514 of them! Then, the Empire State Building began using renewable energy. Just recently, ESRT moved the other thirteen office buildings that it owns over to wind power. For the first time, all of ESRT's buildings were powered by the wind.
ESRT buys electricity from a company called Green Mountain Energy. Green Mountain Energy uses wind turbines to make electricity without creating any pollution. Powering ESRT's office buildings with wind is as good for the environment as keeping all of New York City's taxis off the roads for one year!
Changing buildings over to wind power helps the environment. However, that's only part of the story. Anthony Malkin, president of ESRT, believes using renewable energy is good business. ESRT expects to save more than $800,000 in electricity costs each year. In addition, Malkin says some companies will pay higher rents because they want to have offices in "green" buildings.
Malkin hopes that making these environmentally-friendly changes to the Empire State Building will inspire other owners to do the same. "Healthy buildings are all part of the future," he says.

Towering over New York City, at a height of 102 stories, the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, and for almost 40 years it was the tallest building in the world. Tourists to New York know their visit isn't complete without an elevator ride to the open-air observation deck on the 86th floor for its 360� panoramic view of the city. A jewel in the crown of the city's skyline, the Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings in the world.
The Empire State Building is owned by Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT). About ten years ago, ESRT began improving the energy efficiency of the nearly 100-year-old building. One way they conserved energy was by upgrading the windows - all 6,514 of them! Then, the Empire State Building started using renewable energy. Recently, ESRT took another big step in reducing the carbon footprint of the thirteen other office buildings it owns by moving them all over to wind power. For the first time, the Empire State Building, as well as all the office buildings owned by ESRT, were powered solely by wind.
Don't expect wind turbines to show up on the roof of the Empire State Building, however. That's not how it works! ESRT purchases electricity from a company called Green Mountain Energy, which converts wind from wind turbines into electricity without creating any pollution. Environmentally speaking, changing over to wind power at all ESRT properties has the same impact as keeping all of New York City's taxis off the roads for one year! Equally important, it makes good commercial sense.
There are important financial reasons for using renewable power. Anthony Malkin, president of ESRT, believes that running a "green" building is good for business. Environmentally-responsible buildings, like the Empire State Building, attract tenants who are willing to pay higher rents for space in a building with a smaller carbon footprint. In addition, ESRT is expected to save more than $800,000 in electricity costs each year.
The Empire State Building is the most famous building ESRT owns. Malkin hopes that other building owners will be inspired by the positive changes being made to this beloved landmark. "Healthy buildings are all part of the future," he says.




What Does Space Smell Like?
Business
On July 16, 1969, NASA launched Apollo 11, its first spacecraft to send astronauts to the moon. Fifty-one years later, on the anniversary of that historic event, a crowdfunding campaign was launched for a new fragrance, which brings the smell of outer space down to Earth - it's called Eau de Space.
"Are you ready for the smell of space?" astronauts at the International Space Station asked the world's first female space tourist, Anousheh Ansari, in 2006. Ansari reported that space smells "... like a burned cookie." Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield says space's "distinctive" smell is like gunpowder. Some space travelers say it has a metallic smell, while others describe it as cream of mushroom soup or fried steak. Of course, astronauts can't take off their helmets during space walks. They can only describe what they smell when they safely remove their helmets back at the spacecraft. That scent of space lingers in the particles on their spacesuits.
In 2008, NASA asked chemist Steve Pearce to create a "spacey" fragrance. Pearce developed a fragrance based on astronauts' descriptions. The idea was to use the fragrance during training, to help new astronauts get used to being in outer space. In the end, NASA never actually used the fragrance during training.
But that wasn't the end of Pearce's unique fragrance. After learning about Pearce's idea, Eau de Space's product manager, Matt Richmond, convinced NASA to release Pearce's formula. Richmond decided to use crowdfunding to raise money to produce the fragrance in the UK. So far, the campaign has raised more than $600,000! "Who knew there were so many space geeks out there like us?" says Richmond. The company's main goal is to support STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) education for students from kindergarten through high school. For every bottle of Eau de Space bought via crowdfunding, the company will donate one bottle to a STEM program in need. Using the fragrance will give students a chance to experience space - and hopefully want to visit someday. Schools can register to receive the bottle through the crowdfunding Web site.
Next, the company wants to release Eau de Luna a fragrance based on the scent of the Moon, which world renown astronaut Buzz Aldrin described as smelling "... like a fireplace."

Life today is different than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. Millions of people are staying home. This hurts companies; they can't make money. Many businesses are closing. But others are finding creative ways to stay open. For example, people stopped going to restaurants. So many restaurants started delivering food.
Ruedi Maguire is a fashion designer. He used to make beautiful dresses. But people aren't buying many dresses now. So, Maguire started making scrubs. Scrubs are special shirts and pants that doctors, nurses and other hospital workers wear.
Spiffy is a car cleaning company. During the crisis, people are driving less. So, Spiffy started cleaning the insides of buildings.
Before COVID-19, Flying Elephant Productions made furniture for big outdoor events. But  COVID-19 stopped these events. What did Flying Elephant Productions do? They saw that many people are working from home; these people need desks. So  Flying Elephant Productions now makes desks.

Why is fashion designer Ruedi Maguire creating blue, gray, and green scrubs instead of dresses? To provide special clothing for nurses and other health workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Maguire says "It's fashion with purpose, and it's amazing to be doing something that helps." Many companies around the world have closed due to the pandemic. But others, like Maguire's, are finding creative ways to stay in business.
In the past, many businesses saw their customers face-to-face. Now, customers are staying home. As a result, businesses have had to "pivot." This means taking the business in a new direction. For example, since people can't eat out, many restaurants now offer delivery and take-out services. Fitness instructors teach classes online, and real estate agents give virtual 3-D tours of homes.
The company Kidadl started as a Web site that helps people plan interesting family trips. Now, people visit Kidadl for inspiration. The site lists 1,500 free activities and ideas to help families have fun at home. Kidadl hopes that after the crisis, they will have new customers for their paid services.
Spiffy is a car cleaning service in the US. But people aren't using their cars much now. So, Spiffy pivoted, and is now sanitizing the insides of buildings.
Because of the crisis, large outdoor events have been cancelled. Flying Elephant Productions used to make furniture and signs for these events. Now, the company is helping people who need to make offices in their homes. How? They are making desks - they've sold over 1,300 so far!
As companies deal with the pandemic, there will be more pivoting. How are businesses in your area pivoting?

Ruedi Maguire is a women's wear fashion designer. But recently, he started producing a very different kind of clothing - hospital scrubs. "It's fashion with purpose, and it's amazing to be doing something that helps," says the UK-based designer, referring to health workers' increased need for protective gear during the COVID-19 crisis. Maguire is just one of the many business owners changing their products or services due to the pandemic. While many companies around the world have been forced to shut down, others are finding creative ways to stay afloat during this economically difficult time.
In the past, many businesses depended on seeing customers face-to-face. Now, with millions of people self-isolating, customers are staying home. As a result, businesses have had to "pivot," and go in another direction. For example, since people can't eat out, many restaurants now offer delivery and take-out services.
Businesses are also taking advantage of social media and video conferencing capabilities. Fitness instructors teach classes on social media. Fashion retailers and interior designers offer customers online consultations instead of meeting in a store or office. And real estate agents are offering potential home buyers virtual 3-D tours of homes.
The company Kidadl started as a Web site that helps people plan interesting trips and activities for their family. To retain their customers, they've had to pivot. Now, parents visit Kidadl's Web site for inspiration; the site lists 1,500 free activities and ideas to help families have fun while they're stuck at home. Hopefully, after the crisis, they will have old and new customers for their paid services.
Spiffy was originally a car maintenance and cleaning service in the US, whose slogan was "Imagine your car feeling new again." But people aren't using their cars much now. So, Spiffy added a new cleaning service - sanitizing the inside of buildings.
Flying Elephant Productions used to make furniture for business conferences, and exhibitions. But these types of events have been cancelled. Now, the company is turning their wood and other materials into desks for people who need to unexpectedly create home offices. So far, they've sold over 1,300 desks via a new online store!
There's sure to be more "pivots" as companies continue to search for alternative ways to keep their businesses going. What recent pivots have you noticed in your area of the globe?





Many people's finances are automated these days. Salaries go directly into bank accounts, and people spend money on hundreds of things without ever touching any actual cash. They use credit cards to shop online and pay bills right from their bank accounts. These automated systems are supposed to make life more convenient. But having everything automated can also lead to spending more money than you have, and saving money can become impossible. That's where kakeibo comes in!
Today, instead of looking for new ways to manage their money, people in Japan are trying an old one. Kakeibo (pronounced kah-keh-boh), which was developed in Japan in 1904, is a system to help you make a budget and stick to it. The word kakeibo means "household finance ledger." It was invented by Hani Motoko, Japan's first female journalist, to help busy women manage their household money - with a pen and paper, not technology.
Do you want to try kakeibo? To begin, write down your income and regular monthly expenses. Then, make one promise to yourself to help you reach your goal. For example, you might say, "I promise I will make coffee at home, instead of buying it at a caf�." As you go through the month, write down all the things you spend money on in four categories, called "pillars" in kakeibo. The pillars are needs, wants, culture, and unexpected. This helps you become more aware of your spending habits and avoid wasting money. At the end of each month, review your budget and ask yourself: How much money do I have? How much money would I like to save? How much am I actually spending? How can I improve on that?  
In 2017, writer Fumiko Chiba published the first kakeibo ledger in English. "Our world is now so fast that everything can be bought and paid for very quickly. A kakeibo helps us slow down and really consider what we buy," says Chiba. One of her tips for kakeibo success is using cash as often as you can, instead of credit cards. Chiba believes people may think twice when buying something with cash, and this helps control unnecessary spending.
 
 

Kakeibo: The Japanese Art of Saving Money
Business
Today, you can shop and bank online, and you can buy almost anything with a credit card. While this may be convenient, people sometimes spend more money than they have. And it's hard to save money.
That's why people in Japan are using a system called kakeibo to budget their money. It was invented in 1904 by Hani Motoko, Japan's first female journalist. Because the system is over 100 years old, the only thing needed is a pen and paper.
Do you want to try kakeibo? To begin, write down how much money you make each month, and things you must pay for, such as rent. Next, make one promise to yourself to help you reach your savings goal. For example, you might say, "I promise I will make coffee at home, instead of buying it at a caf�." During the month, write down everything you buy in a special kakeibo notebook. Each item goes into one of four categories: needs, wants, culture, and unexpected. Writing the information down keeps you aware of your spending, so you waste less money. At the end of each month, ask yourself: How much money do I have? How much money do I want to save? How much am I really spending? How can I do better?  
Recently, writer Fumiko Chiba published the first kakeibo book in English. "Our world is now so fast that everything can be bought and paid for very quickly," she says. "A kakeibo helps us slow down and really consider what we buy."

Kakeibo: The Japanese Art of Saving Money
Business
It's fun to spend money. But sometimes, people spend too much money. Here is one answer to the problem.
In Japan, people save money with kakeibo. Do you know what that is? Kakeibo helps people budget their money.
To do kakeibo, you need a pen and a special notebook. First, you write your salary in the notebook. What do you spend money on? Write that next. You spend money on things you need. You spend money on things you want. You spend money on culture, like concerts and movies. There are unexpected things too. It's important to write everything in the notebook. This helps you keep track of your money.
At the end of the month, you check your budget. How much did you spend? How much money do you have? How much did you save? Can you spend less next month?
Kakeibo is more than 100 years old. But people use it today. Do you want to save money with kakeibo?

Jos� Adolfo Quisocala lives in Arequipa, Peru. When Quisocala was seven, he saw many children working. The children worked instead of going to school. The children worked to get money for their families.
Quisocala wanted to help these children save money for the future. He wanted them to use some of the money to pay for school. So, when Quisocala was 11 years old, he started a bank for children. He called the bank Banco del Estudiante Bartselana.
Quisocala's bank is different from other banks. Most banks only take money. Banco del Estudiante Bartselana takes money or recyclables, like plastic bottles. The bank gives each child credit for their recyclables. Credit is like money in their account. A recycling company turns the recyclables into something new. At Banco del Estudiante Bartselana, children learn to save money and help the environment.
When Banco del Estudiante Bartselana started, it had 20 customers. Today, it has more than 2,000 customers. They are between 10 and 18 years old. Quisocala says, "Children are the hope for tomorrow."

Jos� Adolfo Quisocala, from Arequipa, Peru, remembers being seven years old. He remembers watching his friends at school wasting their money on candy and toys. They never saved it. On his way to school each day, Quisocala also saw children working to help their families earn money. Quisocala wanted to help these working children save some of this money for the future.
Quisocala thought about how to help children save money. At first - with his father's help - Quisocala looked for "child friendly" banks, where children could open a savings account. But the banks were requiring a lot of money to open an account. So, when Quisocala was 11 years old, he started his own bank, Banco del Estudiante Bartselana.
Banco del Estudiante Bartselana helps children set savings goals. Children can only take out money once they reach their goal. If a child has no money, that's OK. The bank also accepts recyclable items. Children can bring in items such as plastic bottles, used notebooks and old sandals (which are sent to a local recycling company). Each item children "deposit" turns into real money in their bank account. This way, even children without any cash can start saving. And while learning to save money, the children are also learning how to care for the environment.
When Quisocala's bank first opened, he had just 20 customers. Today, more than 2,000 children use Banco del Estudiante Bartselana. Customers are between the ages of 10 and 18. There's even a special card children can use to get money from cash machines. Quisocala has won many awards, including the Children's Climate Prize. Says Quisocala, "Children are the hope for tomorrow and our environment."

When Jos� Adolfo Quisocala was seven years old, he decided he wanted to open a bank. It would be a bank for kids in his town of Arequipa, Peru. The bank would allow the children to save money, and help them get out of poverty.
Quisocala came up with the idea when he realized that other kids in his town didn't understand the importance of saving money. Many of his classmates spent the little money they had on toys or candy. He also saw children his age working instead of going to school. They were earning money for their families. Quisocala wanted to enable these children to save some of this money for the future.
At first, Quisocala - together with his father - looked for existing banks where children could open savings accounts. But the banks required a certain amount of money in order to open an account. The amount was much too high for the kids in Arequipa.
So, when Quisocala was 11 years old, he fulfilled his dream and opened his own bank, Banco del Estudiante Bartselana. At first, the bank had 20 customers. Today, Banco del Estudiante Bartselana offers loans, microinsurance, and other financial services to more than 2,000 children between the ages of 10 and 18. The kids also have personal debit cards to withdraw money from cash machines.
Banco del Estudiante Bartselana sets savings goals, and children can only withdraw money once a goal is met. In order to make Banco del Estudiante Bartselana accessible to as many kids as possible, kids can "deposit" recyclables instead of money. Children can bring in items such as plastic bottles, used notebooks and old flip flops. This allows kids without any cash to start and grow their own savings accounts. Quisocala's "eco-bank" gives the children credit on their account according to the number of recyclables they deposit. The recyclables are then sent to a local recycling company. So, while learning to manage their money, the children are also learning to care for the environment.
Quisocala has won many international awards, including the Children's Climate Prize, which focuses on protecting the environment. He won the prize in 2018, when he was 13 years old. As Quisocala says, "Children are the hope for tomorrow and our environment."




The Gig Economy
Business
A generation ago, most people had stable 9 to 5 jobs, often staying with the same employer for many years. But a changing global economy and advancing technology are transforming the modern-day workforce. Instead of working a full-time job for a single employer, many people are working as independent contractors or freelancers, doing a collection of flexible part-time jobs. These workers are part of the "gig economy".
In a gig economy, workers do different small jobs, or "gigs", such as giving someone a ride or making a food delivery. They get paid for each separate job that they do. In many cases, their "bosses" are apps. An example is the well-known app Uber. Uber is like a taxi service, except that the drivers are everyday people who use their own cars. These gig workers earn money each time they give someone a lift. Drivers can choose when to take customers and which customers to take based on where they need to go.
Another example is Handy, an app that helps customers find a professional handyperson to perform household tasks, such as plumbing or painting. Handy gig workers choose which jobs they'll do. Some gig workers are personal shoppers. They do grocery shopping and deliveries for customers, through apps like Instacart. And with the app Airbnb, gig workers earn money by renting out their homes.
An advantage of gig work is flexibility. You get to decide what jobs you want to take and when you want to work. Gig work can also be a good option for retirees who want extra income without having to work a set number of hours each day. Gig work is also relatively quick and easy to get. You don't need a college degree, a resume, or to sit through interviews.
Gig workers do face challenges, however. As freelancers, there are no laws requiring them to receive minimum wage, nor do they receive paid vacation or sick days. They don't receive health insurance or retirement benefits either, And while some companies, like Instacart, pay workers regularly, not all companies offer steady pay schedules.
Today, approximately 150 million workers in North America and Western Europe are part of the gig economy. Can you see yourself joining them? Maybe you already have!

Some gig workers go grocery shopping for customers, using apps like Instacart. Others rent out their homes, through websites like Airbnb.
A benefit to gig work is the flexibility to choose when you want to work. Another benefit is that you don't need a college degree or resume. Gig work can also be a good option for people who want to earn a little extra money on the side.
But there are downsides to gig work, too. You don't get the benefits a full-time job gives, such as health insurance or sick days. And gig companies don't have to pay minimum wage.

Some people work full-time at one job. Other people do many separate jobs, or "gigs". They get paid for each job that they do. When people make money doing different gigs, they are part of the "gig economy".
With the company Uber, people pay you to drive them places. When you give someone a ride, you are doing a gig. You can choose how many gigs you want to do.
Are you good at doing jobs around the house? If so, you can do gigs for the company Handy. These gigs are projects in people's homes. You might paint a room, or fix a table.
With Instacart, you go grocery shopping for customers. With Airbnb, you get money when you rent out your home.
With gig work, you decide when you want to work. You decide how much you want to work. But gig workers don't get benefits like full-time workers do.
There are millions of gig workers around the world. Do you want to be one of them?

Do you shop online? Today, there are apps that make shopping online even easier. The apps have visual search engines. In a visual search engine, you upload a picture. The search engine finds other pictures online that are exactly the same, or a lot like it.
Nowadays, some businesses are using visual search engines. One example is eBay. Take a picture of an item that you like, or find a photo that is already on your phone. Upload the picture to eBay's visual search engine. The search engine finds items on eBay that are like the item in your picture. Now you can buy the item.
Pinterest has a visual search engine, too. It's called Lens. Take a screenshot of something you want, like a cool pair of shoes. Next, upload the picture onto Lens. Lens shows you where you can buy the shoes online. Then, it lets you buy the shoes. Lens also shows you what clothes look good with the shoes!
With visual search engines it's quick, easy, and fun to shop online.

You see a jacket you like. You take a picture of it with your smartphone. An app then tells you where you can buy the jacket. Apps like this one use visual search engines.
In a visual search engine, instead of typing in words, you upload a picture. The search engine scours millions of online images to find a picture like the one you uploaded. To do a search, you can either take a photo, use an image saved on your phone, or take a screenshot of an image you find online.
Businesses are starting to use visual search engines to help people shop. The online marketplace eBay is one example. Upload a photo of an item you want, and you'll get a list of the same or similar items sold on eBay.
The Web site Pinterest has a visual search tool called Lens. Lens does more than find similar images. If you take a picture of an avocado, you might get avocado recipes or tips on growing avocados. Take a screenshot of a cool pair of shoes, and you might get ideas for clothes to wear with the shoes.
Some items are hard to name or describe in words. With a visual search engine, no writing is necessary. A visual search engine can also search for out-of-stock items, so you can locate items that are hard to find. And visual search engines save you time. If you see something you like, you can buy it within minutes.
More and more visual search engines are being developed and used in business. Get ready for a new era � of "photo shopping".

Visual search engines also help businesses by giving new life to old products, by searching out-of-stock items in addition to new ones.
For customers, visual searches shorten shopping time by closing the gap between discovering an item and purchasing it. They also help consumers find items online when they can't think of the words to describe them. Visual searches can also save consumers money. Take a screenshot of an expensive item, and find out where you can buy something similar for a more affordable price.

Large cities are often trying to improve public transportation, making commuting comfortable and convenient. But while many cities have effective public transportation systems, many still have a "last-mile problem". This refers to the problem of getting to and from transit stops. For example, you may take a bus to work, but when you get off the bus, you still have a long way to go to get to the office. One way to bridge this distance, and solve the last-mile problem, is by using "dockless" electric scooters.
Recently, private scooter companies have deposited dozens of motorized scooters in large U.S. cities, such as San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The scooters are for the public to use, to get from one point in the city to another.
A smartphone app shows you where to find a scooter near you. When you locate the scooter, you use the app to unlock it and make it go. Unlike city rental bikes, the scooters don't have special drop-off and pickup stations, or "docks". So once you get to your destination, you can just leave the scooter behind, ready for the next rider. Scooter companies charge one dollar to start using the service, then fifteen cents per minute after that. Most scooters go approximately 15 miles (about 24 kilometers) an hour. That's five times faster than walking.
For some people, dockless scooters are the perfect solution. But for many others, they're a nuisance. Because the scooters can be dropped off anywhere, they are often carelessly tossed in the middle of crowded sidewalks or blocking entrances to buildings, annoying pedestrians and putting them at risk for injury. Some scooters get vandalized, becoming dangerous for riders who may try to stop their scooter only to find that the brakes have been tampered with. In addition, scooter companies pay individuals to charge scooter batteries overnight. This has given rise to a cutthroat "charging" culture, where people compete to collect as many scooters as they can.
What do you think about dockless scooters - solution, problem, or just another fad that will soon fade away?

Large cities are always trying to make public transportation more convenient for commuters. Even with improvements, however, getting to and from bus or train stops can be difficult.

Most scooters go around 15 miles (about 24 kilometers) an hour. That's five times faster than walking!
For some people, dockless scooters are the perfect solution for short trips around the city. But for many others, they're a nuisance. Because the scooters can be dropped off anywhere, riders often leave them in the middle of crowded sidewalks. They also leave them in front of buildings, blocking entrances. Besides annoying pedestrians, they can also cause injuries. Some scooters also get vandalized, which is dangerous for riders. A rider may try to stop their scooter, only to find that the brakes have been tampered with.

But many people don't like the scooters. They say they are dangerous. Some riders leave scooters in the middle of the sidewalk or in doorways. Sometimes, people trip over these scooters.

Many people like to shop. But they don't like waiting in line to pay. Now, there's a store called Amazon Go.  It has no cashiers and no checkout. So you never have to wait in line!
To shop at Amazon Go, you put the store's app on your smartphone. Then, you walk through a special gate to enter the store. You choose the items that you want. You put them in a bag. The cameras and sensors in the store watch what you put in your bag. The information goes to a computer. The computer charges your Amazon account.  Finally, you walk back out through the gate.
Later, a receipt comes to your smartphone. You also get a "trip timer". The trip timer shows you how long you shopped. One happy customer said she did all her shopping in four minutes and thirty-eight seconds!

One day, Dave Ross walked into a store, placed some snacks in a bag, and left the store without paying a cashier. "As I walked toward the exit, it felt like shoplifting," said Ross. But he wasn't shoplifting. In fact, a receipt for his items was sent to his smartphone. Dave had just visited the Amazon Go store.
Amazon Go is located in downtown Seattle, Washington, USA. It opened to the public in January 2018. Amazon Go looks like a regular store - except there aren't any cashiers. And that means no waiting in line at the checkout. Instead of shopping carts, the store gives shoppers orange canvas bags. To shop at Amazon Go, all you need is an Amazon account and a smartphone with the Amazon Go app. 
To enter Amazon Go, customers pass through turnstiles. Inside the store, there are hundreds of cameras and sensors. These devices monitor what shoppers put into their bags. Then, the items are added to a virtual shopping cart. Once shoppers finish taking their items, they simply exit the store. In addition to a receipt, customers get a special "trip timer". The trip timer shows how much time they spent shopping. "Best four minutes and thirty-eight seconds of shopping I've ever done," said one excited customer. So far, Amazon won't discuss if it's opening more Amazon Go stores.
Do you think it would feel like stealing to shop at Amazon Go? Or, would it be the best - and quickest - shopping experience of your life?

Dave Ross walked into a store, placed some snacks in a bag, and left the store without paying a cashier. "As I walked toward the exit, it felt like shoplifting," he says. "I was prepared to take off running. But no one chased me." No one intercepted Dave because he wasn't shoplifting. In fact, minutes after leaving the store, he received a receipt for his items on his smartphone. Dave had just made his first visit to the Amazon Go store.
The Amazon Go store, located in downtown Seattle, Washington, USA, opened to the public in January 2018. It had been operational since December 2016, being tested by Amazon employees. Amazon Go looks like a regular store, with one glaring exception - there aren't any cashiers. And no cashiers means no checkout lines. There aren't even any shopping carts or baskets. Instead, the store provides free, bright-orange canvas bags. To experience the world's first Amazon Go, all you need is an Amazon account linked to a credit card and the Amazon Go app on your smartphone. 
A turnstile at the store's entrance scans a code from the app. Then, customers enter the 167-square-meter space. Hundreds of cameras and sensors track shoppers, determine what they put into their bags, and add the items to a virtual shopping cart. When shoppers have finished, they walk back through the turnstile and exit the store. With their receipt, customers get a "trip timer", showing how much time they spent shopping. "Best four minutes and thirty-eight seconds of shopping I've ever done," raved one patron. 
There are some challenging aspects to Amazon Go's model, however. Opening more Amazon Go stores could mean less need for cashiers, the second-most common job in the USA. But Gianna Perini, the head of Amazon Go, explains that this isn't a problem. "We've just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience." Amazon won't yet discuss if it plans to open more Amazon Go stores.
Would you feel like a thief shopping at Amazon Go? Or would it be the best - and quickest - shopping experience of your life?

Many people today read the news online, through smartphone apps, or watch it on TV. And some still sit down with a newspaper. But a whole new type of journalism is emerging. It's called "virtual reality journalism" (VR journalism). And it's changing the way we experience news altogether.
In VR journalism, you use special headsets together with your smartphone to experience a news story firsthand, as if you were actually there! When watching a story about a hurricane, for example, you get a 360-degree view of the winds blowing and rain falling, as if you've been transported to the scene.
Major news sources, such as The New York Times, The Guardian, and CNN, have opened special VR divisions.  They've sent out Google Cardboard headsets to allow viewers to explore their VR pieces. The New York Times, for example, mailed out 1.2 million pairs of headsets.  The Guardian sent out 87,000 pairs.
One of the goals of VR journalism is to get viewers to understand what people halfway around the world - or even in the same city - are going through, and to empathize with them. The Guardian has created several VR pieces to try and achieve this goal. One piece, called "The Party", takes you into the mind of a girl with autism. Another piece, "6x9", brings you into a tiny prison cell to "experience" what solitary confinement is like for prisoners. And "First Impressions" takes you through the development of a newborn baby. As you can see, VR journalism can help people see things from a whole new perspective.
VR journalism isn't a brand-new invention. Journalist Nonny de la Pena has been producing VR stories since 2013, and is considered the pioneer of VR journalism. Her company, Emblematic Group, creates VR versions of real events. De la Pena talks about the challenges that come with this new form of journalism, such as technology issues, high production costs, and sensitivity concerns, to name a few. Yet, de la Pena is hopeful. She believes that VR journalism has the power to "evoke change" and "make people better global citizens".

Many companies are designing flying taxis. These "air taxis" will look like small helicopters. They'll carry just a few people at a time. Air taxis will be electric, so they won't hurt the environment.
Most air taxis won't have pilots! They'll be autonomous. The taxis will take off and land at special landing pads around the city. Some landing pads will be on roofs of buildings. People will order air taxis with a smartphone app.
The city of Dubai wants to have an air taxi service by 2022. They recently did a test flight of their "Autonomous Air Taxi" (AAT).  It rose 200 meters in the air and stayed there for five minutes. In the future, AATs will fly to places 30 minutes away.
The French company Airbus will use air taxis to take passengers to airports, train stations, and bus stations.
The Chinese company EHANG is putting iPads in their air taxis. Passengers will use the iPad to choose where they want to go.
Do you think air taxis will really get off the ground?

You're in a taxi on the way to the airport, but you're stuck in traffic. You wish the taxi could fly. Well, your wish might come true.
Today, many companies are designing flying taxis. These "air taxis" will lift up vertically like a helicopter. They will take off and land on landing pads around the city, and fly small groups of passengers to their destinations. Air taxis will be electric, making them environmentally friendly. They'll help make the roads less crowded.
Dubai wants to become the first city with a flying taxi service, and hopes to have one by 2022. The city recently conducted a test flight of their "Autonomous Air Taxi" (AAT), built by German company Volocopter. The AAT hovered 200 meters in the air for five minutes. Eventually, AATs will take passengers on flights of up to 30 minutes. Customers will order AATs using a smartphone app.
The French company Airbus is also developing an air taxi. Initially, their taxis will be piloted by humans, but they'll eventually be autonomous. Airbus will use its air taxis to fly passengers between airports, train stations, and bus stations.
The Chinese company EHANG is developing a one-seater air taxi. Its taxis will have iPads. Passengers will use the iPad to choose where they want to go.
Volocopter, Airbus, and EHANG are just a few of the companies in the air taxi race. And there's still a lot more work to do. Companies need to improve their taxi designs, and make sure they're safe. They'll need to make sure their taxis follow air traffic rules.

You're in a taxi on the way to the airport, but you're stuck in traffic. If only the taxi could take off, and fly you over the endless rows of cars, so you don't miss your flight! This wish may actually come true in the not-too-distant future.
Several companies are developing flying taxis. These are helicopter-like vehicles designed to transport small groups of people to nearby destinations quickly, by bypassing ground traffic.
Dubai is working hard to become the first city in the world to offer a fully operational, autonomous air taxi service. The Dubai Civil Aviation Authority recently performed a test flight of their "Autonomous Air Taxi" (AAT) built by the German company Volocopter. The two-seater aircraft lifted up vertically like a helicopter, and hovered about 200 meters in the air for five minutes. The eventual goal is for the AAT to take passengers for a flight of up to 30 minutes at a speed of 50 km/h.
Customers will order an air taxi using a smartphone app, and the AAT will arrive at the "voloport" nearest to them to take them to their destination. Dubai officials hope to have a functioning AAT service by 2022.
Another major company making strides in the flying taxi industry is the French company Airbus, which expects to have an operational service by 2023. The four-person vehicles will have human pilots at first, but will eventually be autonomous. Airbus' plan is for its flying taxis to connect major transportation hubs, so passengers can travel easily between train stations, airports, and bus stations. The taxis will fly along fixed, predetermined routes.
Chinese company EHANG is another company in the air taxi race. They are designing single-seat vehicles. These air taxis will have iPads, so passengers can choose their destination. And the list goes on...
There are still many challenges to overcome. Some involve technical design, safety standards, and air traffic rules. And air taxi companies still need to run test flights with people aboard.
A potential benefit to air taxis is that they're electric, and therefore an environmentally friendly form of transportation. They're also expected to help ease congestion on the roads. Many people have high hopes for this transportation innovation. We'll see if it actually gets off the ground.





For many people, there's nothing as tasty as their grandmothers' cooking. And sharing these homemade flavors with customers is what restaurant Enoteca Maria is all about.

At Enoteca Maria, on Staten Island, New York, you'll find grandmothers in the kitchen instead of chefs. The restaurant's owner, Jody Scaravella, thought of the concept after his grandmother, and then his mother, passed away. "Seeing an Italian grandmother in the kitchen cooking was my idea of comfort," he says. Scaravella, who grew up in New York, learned about his Italian heritage - and its culinary culture - from his grandmother, and he wanted to pass it on.

Enoteca Maria, which is named after Scaravella's mother Maria, was purely an Italian restaurant at first. Its cooks were Italian nonnas from different regions of Italy. (Nonna is the Italian word for "grandmother".) Eventually, however, Scaravella realized that people of every culture were coming to enjoy the Italian grandmothers' cooking. And he thought to himself, "How great would it be if we featured everybody's grandmother."

Today, Enoteca Maria has between 30 and 40 nonnas from around the world. Each day you'll find two nonnas in the kitchen. There is always one Italian nonna, and a second nonna from a different country, such as Japan, Ireland, or Argentina.

The nonnas decide which traditional foods will be on the menu each day. The recipes they use have been passed down through the generations. They got their recipes from their mothers and grandmothers, who got them from their mothers and grandmothers. Some of the recipes are hundreds of years old.

When dining at Enoteca Maria, you might find Nonna Rosari, from Abruzzo, Italy, cooking her spaghetti alla chitarra, or Nonna Zena preparing her mutabbal, a Syrian eggplant dip. Or perhaps you'll be served a piece of Nonna Rosa Maria's tortas de zanahoria, a Colombian carrot cake.

Both the customers and the nonnas benefit from the experience. Nonnas often leave the kitchen during the meal to interact with customers. And customers often give the nonnas a standing ovation. "I feel like I'm cooking for my family," says Nonna Rosa, from Veneto, Italy. "And that's what the customers become - my family."

Business
Many people love their grandmothers' cooking. That's why restaurant Enoteca Maria, in New York, hires grandmothers to cook the food.

Jody Scaravella, the owner of Enoteca Maria, has Italian roots. He learned a lot about Italian customs and foods from his grandmother, who often cooked Italian dishes. After his grandmother and mother died, Scaravella thought of opening a restaurant with grandmother chefs. "Seeing an Italian grandmother in the kitchen cooking was my idea of comfort," he says.

At first, Enoteca Maria only served Italian food. Each day, there were two Italian nonnas cooking food from their region in Italy. (Nonna means "grandmother" in Italian.) Yet people of all different cultures came to the restaurant to enjoy the nonnas' cooking. When Scaravella saw this, he decided to add grandmother chefs from other cultures, too.

Today, there are still two nonnas each day. One nonna is Italian. The other nonna is from a different country, such as Japan or Argentina. The nonnas get to decide what foods to serve. They use recipes that have been passed down from their mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers.

If you dine at Enoteca Maria, you might see Nonna Rosari from Abruzzo, Italy, making spaghetti alla chitarra. Or Nonna Zena from Syria might be preparing her mutabbal, an eggplant dip. Or maybe you'll get a piece of Nonna Rosa Maria's tortas de zanahoria, a Colombian carrot cake.

The nonnas often come out of the kitchen to speak with customers during the meal. "I feel like I'm cooking for my family," says Nonna Rosa, from Veneto, Italy. "And that's what the customers become - my family."

Grandmother Chefs
Business
Do you love your grandmothers' cooking?  Then go to restaurant Enoteca Maria, in New York. At Enoteca Maria, grandmothers are the chefs!

Jody Scaravella owns Enoteca Maria. Scaravella is Italian, but he grew up in New York. His grandmother taught him about Italian culture. She cooked Italian foods. When Scaravella's grandmother and mother died, Scaravella opened Enoteca Maria. He wanted to be around grandmothers. It made him feel better.

Every day there are two grandmothers, or nonnas, in the restaurant's kitchen. (Nonna means "grandmother" in Italian.) One nonna is from Italy; she cooks Italian food. The other nonna is from a different country. For example, Nonna Zena is from Syria. She makes mutabbal, (eggplant dip). Nonna Rosa Maria is from Colombia. She makes tortas de zanahoria, (carrot cake). The nonnas decide what foods to make. They use recipes they got from their mothers and grandmothers.

Nonnas also talk with customers. "I feel like I'm cooking for my family," says Nonna Rosa, from Veneto, Italy. "And that's what the customers become - my family."




Ocean Exploration for Everyone
Science & Technology
Scientists want to study the deep sea. But to study the deep sea is very expensive. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Ocean Discovery League (ODL) wants to help. The ODL's scientists made a special tool. It's called the Maka Niu. The Maka Niu only costs about $700 to make. Now, more scientists can explore the deep sea. Even people who aren't scientists can buy it. Then they can explore the deep sea too.
The Maka Niu looks like a white plastic pipe. It has a camera. It also has sensors. The sensors give you different kinds of information. The sensors check how salty the water is. They tell you how deep the water is. They also check how hot or cold the water is.
After the Maka Niu collects information, people study the information. They share it with scientists on the Internet. This helps scientists all over the world.
The ODL is making more deep-sea tools too. The Maka Niu is just the beginning!

Ocean Exploration for Everyone
Science & Technology
Some scientists study the ocean. They use cameras, sensors, and other tools. But they don't know a lot about the very deep parts of the ocean. Over 99% of the deep sea has never even been explored. This is because deep ocean exploration is very expensive. Equipment for exploring the deep sea can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, only a few countries and companies can afford it. That's why researchers at the organization Ocean Discovery League (ODL) created a new device. It's called the Maka Niu.
Researchers say the Maka Niu can be built for $700. That means that even many "ordinary" people (non-scientists) will be able to afford it. They'll be able to collect information about the ocean and share it with scientists.
The Maka Niu, meaning "coconut eye" in Hawaiian, is a white, plastic pipe that's about the size of a large flashlight. The battery-powered device has a camera, and sensors. It can check how deep and how salty the water is. It can also measure the ocean's temperature. Human divers can carry the Maka Niu with them as they explore. The device can also be lowered down into the water and brought up later. In the ocean, the Maka Niu can take pictures, and collect data. This information can then be analyzed, and shared on the Internet, for researchers worldwide to use.
The ODL recently sent 13 Maka Nius to researchers in different countries, such as South Africa, Portugal, and Bermuda. The ODL's founder, Katy Croff Bell, is excited to have them use the device. "I can't wait to see what they find and learn."

Ocean Exploration for Everyone
Science & Technology
Scientists have been exploring the oceans for many years, using cameras, sensors, and other tools. Yet today, over 99% of the deep sea has still not been studied, and remains a mystery. The reason is the cost. Few countries or companies have the hundreds of thousands of dollars it takes to develop equipment needed for deep water exploration. To solve this problem, the organization Ocean Discovery League (ODL) has developed a new device. It's called the Maka Niu, and it makes deep-sea exploration much more affordable. 
Researchers say the Maka Niu (meaning "coconut eye" in Hawaiian, and often called the "CocoCam") costs only about $700 to build. Because of its reasonable price, not only scientists, but also people in the general public, will be able to use it to collect information about the ocean. Then, they'll be able to share this information with scientists.
The Maka Niu is a lightweight, battery-powered device with a camera, GPS, and sensors. It can measure, for example, how salty the ocean is, the temperature of the water, and the water's depth. The device is a white pipe about the size of a large flashlight (261 millimeters long). It's made of a strong plastic that protects the technology inside at depths of 1,500 meters. The Maka Niu can be carried by a human diver, or weighted down to fall to the ocean floor, and be retrieved later.
Once the Maka Niu has finished doing its job, and is brought up from the ocean, the images and information it collected can be analyzed. They can then be uploaded to the Internet, to share with the worldwide scientific community.
The ODL recently sent 13 Maka Niu prototypes to researchers around the world, for free, to study the ocean. The devices went to such countries as South Africa, Portugal, and Bermuda. "I can't wait to see what they find and learn," says Katy Croff Bell, an oceanographer and the founder of the ODL. And she is excited about continuing to make deep-sea exploration tools more accessible. "Maka Niu," says Bell, "is just the beginning."





Recently, a group of scientists from Robotic Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, a Swiss research university, went hiking in the Alps. They brought their four-legged friend, ANYmal, with them. Although ANYmal walks like a dog - and moves like a dog in other ways too - it's actually an autonomous robot. The scientists wanted to see how the robot dog would handle the rough terrain on the hiking trail.
Climbing up a steep mountain, ANYmal had to navigate rocky surfaces, slippery ground, and tree roots. Despite all the challenges, however, ANYmal reached the top of the mountain in 31 minutes - faster than the average human hiker. Besides taking ANYmal hiking, the scientists tested the robot dog in a variety of other natural and urban settings. ANYmal walked up and down stairs, moved over gaps, and squeezed through tight spaces.
ANYmal robots were invented to do tasks that are unpleasant, dirty, or dangerous for humans. They can be used to inspect dangerous areas of chemical plants, for example, to make sure the equipment is working properly. ANYmal collects data using a microphone, cameras and sensors. It can sense if there is a chemical leak, for example, or locate broken equipment, and alert humans that it needs repair. ANYmal has a light, so it can work in the dark, and it's waterproof, so it can work in rain and snow.
Since ANYmal is not controlled by humans, it can enter dangerous areas alone, allowing humans to stay safe. As it encounters new environments and situations, the robot uses special technology to make its own "decisions'' about how to move. Because ANYmal works well in unfamiliar situations and on difficult terrain, it can help during and after natural disasters, such as earthquakes or forest fires. The robot can be used in search-and-rescue missions.
ANYmal isn't limited to helping us here on Earth, though. ETH Zurich scientists believe that ANYmal is rugged enough to be used on space missions to other planets. ANYmal may one day explore underground caves on Mars. And ANYmal, the robot dog, is ready for the challenge!

Robot Dogs
Science & Technology
Meet the "robot dog" called ANYmal. Like a real dog, ANYmal has four legs. It can walk, run, and crawl. ANYmal was created to do jobs that are dangerous for humans.
ANYmal can be sent to explore a dangerous area, such as a chemical plant, and collect information about it. To collect the information, ANYmal has a microphone, cameras, and sensors. If it senses a chemical leak, for example, it will alert human workers.
 
ANYmal is autonomous - it is not controlled by humans. Special technology lets ANYmal "decide" how and where to move on its own, even in new, unfamiliar places. It can also fit into tight spaces. This makes ANYmal useful during and after earthquakes or forest fires. The robot can search for people who are lost or need help. Then, it can tell the firefighters where these people are. ANYmal is waterproof too, so it can work in rain and snow.
Robotic Systems Lab in Zurich, Switzerland invented ANYmal. While developing the robot dog, scientists tested it to see how well it would work in different indoor and outdoor environments. ANYmal walked up and down stairs. It walked across wide gaps. One day, the scientists took ANYmal hiking up a mountain. There were a lot of rocks and tree roots to climb over. In some spots, the ground was slippery. But ANYmal reached the top of the mountain faster than the average human.
In addition to helping humans on Earth, ANYmal will be able to help humans explore space. There are underground caves on Mars, for example, and ANYmal is ready to investigate!

Robot Dogs
Science & Technology
Meet a "robot dog" named ANYmal. ANYmal has four legs. It can walk, run, and crawl. But ANYmal isn't a pet. ANYmal does jobs that are dangerous for humans.
One job ANYmal can do is help after an earthquake. ANYmal can find survivors. Then, the robot dog can tell humans workers where the survivors are. 
Humans don't control ANYmal. The robot dog moves on its own. It has special technology. The technology lets ANYmal know where to go.
ANYmal also has special equipment. It has a microphone, cameras, and sensors. This equipment helps ANYmal do its jobs.
Robotic Systems Lab, in Zurich, made ANYmal. The scientists tested the robot dog. They gave ANYmal tasks to do. ANYmal walked up and down stairs. It walked in rain and snow. It climbed a mountain. It climbed over rocks, and around trees.
The scientists at the Robotic Systems Lab think ANYmal can even explore Mars. ANYmal may get to Mars before humans do!





For children, hospitals can be scary. The young patients may feel worried and stressed. But Robin the Robot can help. Robin helps children in hospitals relax and feel better.
How does Robin help? Robin plays games with the children. Robin also tells stories and jokes. Robin talks to the young patients about different topics. They may talk about school, or their favorite foods. Robin can also explain to the children what treatment they are getting.
Robin is about 1.2 meters tall. That is the size of an eight-year-old child. When patients talk to Robin, they feel like they are talking to another child. But Robin doesn't look like a child. Robin's body is white plastic. Robin's head is a screen.
Expper Technologies is the company that invented Robin. The company gave Robin special technology. Robin knows when a child feels sad, angry, or worried. Then, Robin knows how to make the child feel better. Robin speaks Spanish, English, and Armenian. The robot is helping children in Armenia, the US, and other countries.
 

Robin the Robot
Science & Technology
A child in the hospital has a new friend, Robin. They talk and play games together. But Robin isn't a child. It's a robot that helps children who are getting medical treatment in hospitals or clinics.
Young patients often feel lonely, worried, or stressed. Robin helps them feel more relaxed by interacting with them. The robot plays games with the children, and tells them stories and jokes. It has conversations with the patients about different topics, such as school, their favorite food, or a medical treatment they'll be having. Robin also distracts children during these procedures. The robot can communicate in three languages - Spanish, English, and Armenian.
And Robin can do something else; it can interpret the expression on a child's face. It can tell if a child is feeling happy, sad, angry, or anxious. Then, it knows how to respond. Robin uses artificial intelligence, so the more it interacts with children the more it learns.
Robin's white, plastic body is shaped like a cone. Its "face" is a screen with two giant eyes. The robot is about the same height as an eight-year-old, so children feel like they're talking to another child. Robin has a wheel at the bottom, which lets it move in all directions.
A recent study showed that young patients felt happier after interacting with Robin. Time magazine chose Robin as one of the best inventions of the year. Robin was invented by a company called Expper Technologies. Karen Khachikyan is the CEO. How does Khachikyan describe Robin? "Robin is kind of an adorable buddy who is always there to support and help during the challenging times."

Robin the Robot
Science & Technology
An eight-year-old patient at a medical clinic in Armenia recently made a new friend, Robin. Robin and the young patient talk about different topics, such as animals. They also play games. But Robin isn't a child. Robin is a robot that provides emotional support for children getting medical treatment in hospitals or clinics.
Children receiving medical treatment often feel scared, lonely, anxious, or stressed. But Robin the Robot can help them deal with their emotions. Robin interacts with the children, reducing their stress. The robot has conversations with the children - real interactive dialogues - on all different topics. They may talk about anything, from their favorite foods to why the child is getting treatment. And Robin can explain to the child what the treatment will be like. Robin also plays games with the children and tells them jokes and stories. Perhaps most importantly, Robin distracts patients during painful medical procedures. Robin can communicate in three languages - Spanish, English, and Armenian.
Robin also has another skill. Using artificial intelligence, Robin interprets children's facial expressions. It recognizes if a child is feeling happy, sad, angry, or anxious, and responds accordingly. And the more Robin interacts with children, the more it "learns," and knows how to react next time.
Robin can move in any direction. The robot's "face" is a rectangular screen that shows two giant eyes and eyebrows. Its body is white and cone-shaped. It is 1.2 meters tall, about the same height as an eight-year-old. Because Robin is the size of a child, when children interact with it, they feel like they're with a friend.
A study at clinics in Armenia showed that young patients were happier after their interactions with Robin. "We were looking for innovative solutions, and we found Robin," says Dr. Hrachuchi Ghazaryan, the head of pediatric services at Wigmore Clinic in Yerevan, Armenia. Time magazine chose Robin as one of the best inventions of the year.
Robin is cheering up young patients around the world, and there are more Robin robots on the way. Karen Khachikyan is the CEO and founder of Expper Technologies, the company that invented Robin. "Robin is kind of an adorable buddy," she says, "who is always there to support and help during the challenging times."

Science & Technology
Scientists around the world do important research to help protect the planet. Whether studying endangered species, air quality, or new ways to conserve water, research requires collecting data. And there is a lot of data to collect, so scientists can often use help. They get this help from ordinary citizens of all ages. These volunteer "citizen scientists" don't even need to have a science degree. They gather information while doing activities they enjoy, such as skiing, hiking, surfing, or biking. Then, they share their results with scientists.
There are thousands of citizen science projects. Many focus on wildlife and the environment. Some citizen scientists measure light pollution, while others study ants or find bees. Would you enjoy biking and hiking combined with bird-watching? Then you can participate in Global Big Day, run by Cornell University, in NY, USA. During this annual event, citizen scientists look for different bird species in specific areas. Using an app called eBird, participants record the birds they see and hear as they bike and hike. They also add other information, such as where and when they saw the birds. Analyzing the data, scientists can better understand and save bird populations.
Scientists research deep inside the ocean, but areas closer to the coast are actually harder to study. That's where surfers can help! The Smartfin is a special electronic fin with sensors that can be attached to a surfboard. The sensors collect data about the surface of the ocean near coastal areas. Smartfin records the surfer's location, and can measure the water's temperature, and other important properties. The data can then be shared with oceanographers and the worldwide scientific community.
Skiers and snowboarders can also help scientists. With the Community Snow Observations project, cold-weather enthusiasts collect data on snow depth on mountains. They measure how deep the snow is, and send the location and measurements through the Mountain Hub app. The observations help scientists predict snow conditions, and improve safety for mountain travelers - by helping skiers avoid avalanches, for example. 
Citizen science allows people all over the world to work together to learn more about protecting our planet. Through these projects, citizen scientists have helped make many significant scientific discoveries.

The Mars Generation
Science & Technology
Alyssa Carson saw a children's TV show about Mars when she was three years old. She wanted to go to Mars, too! It became her dream to go to Mars.
At age seven, Carson went to space camp. She built a small rocket there. She also went on exciting video "space flights." At age nine, Carson met Sandra Magnus, a real NASA astronaut. After that, Carson knew she could become an astronaut.
Carson worked hard to reach her goal. She learned how to fly an airplane. She went underwater diving, too. Under water is a place without oxygen - just like Mars. Today, Carson is studying at university.
After university, Carson hopes to join NASA's astronaut program. But NASA only chooses the best people. One astronaut class only had 12 students! Carson knows it won't be easy.
Carson is part of "The Mars Generation" - young people who hope to walk on Mars in the 2030s. Maybe Carson's dream will come true. Maybe she will go to Mars!

The Mars Generation
Science & Technology
When she was three years old, Alyssa Carson saw a TV show about cartoon animals going to Mars. That's when Carson began dreaming of visiting Mars herself. At age seven, Carson went to her first of seven space camps. At space camp, she built model rockets. She also went on simulated space flights and learned about the history of space travel. Then, at age nine, Carson met Sandra Magnus, a former astronaut from NASA. After that meeting, Carson knew she could turn her astronaut dreams into reality.
NASA has a two-year training program for astronauts, and Carson hopes to go there. NASA only accepts people who are physically fit. They must also have an advanced university degree, so Carson is studying astrobiology at the Florida Institute of Technology. In addition, NASA wants people with experience. So, Carson learned to be a pilot. She also went skydiving to prepare for the feeling of taking off in a rocket. She trained as an underwater diver to learn about being in a place without oxygen - like on Mars. Carson even worked on a team doing research about space suits.
After university, Carson plans on applying to NASA's astronaut training program. However, it's very difficult to get in. Recently, 18,000 people applied, but NASA only chose 12! Carson knows that her excellent resume  isn't enough. "You want to have something that helps you stick out," she says. Carson hopes talking about space with her 300,000 Instagram followers will help.
Carson and a group of friends all dream of walking on Mars in the 2030s. They call themselves "The Mars Generation."

The Mars Generation
Science & Technology
When Alyssa Carson was three years old, she saw a TV show about cartoon animals going to Mars. Immediately fascinated, she spent the rest of her childhood dreaming about visiting the Red Planet. "I started watching videos of rovers landing on Mars," remembers Carson. "I had a gigantic map of Mars in my room." When she was seven, Carson attended her first of seven space camps. At space camp, she learned about the history of space exploration, built model rockets, and went on simulated space missions. The highlight for Carson, however, came when she was nine and met former NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus. Magnus inspired Carson to follow her dream of becoming an astronaut.
To reach her dream, Carson plans on applying to NASA's two-year astronaut training program after she completes her university studies. "It's actually a super competitive field to get into, and it takes a lot of hard work, but it is possible," says Carson. For a recent astronaut training class, for example, 18,000 people applied, but only 12 were chosen! Basic requirements include a master's degree and being physically fit. And NASA wants trainees with work experience, so building a resume is key.
Everything Carson does is focused on getting into the NASA program. She is studying astrobiology at the Florida Institute of Technology. She has a pilot's certificate. She trained as an underwater diver to experience being in an environment without oxygen - like on Mars. She went skydiving to prepare for the feeling of taking off in a rocket. She even participated in Project PoSSUM, an organization for space research, where she worked on a team designing space suits.

As Carson knows, in order to be chosen by NASA, you need more than the minimum requirements. According to Carson, "You want to have something that helps you stick out," so that NASA will notice you among thousands of hopeful applicants. To that end, Carson encourages an interest in space with her 300,000 Instagram followers. She is part of a group of young people who all enjoy sharing the latest developments in space exploration with their online audience. Hoping to walk on the Red Planet in the 2030s, Carson and others like her call themselves "The Mars Generation."




Up, Up and Away...to Space!
Science & Technology
Imagine yourself floating up and away from Earth. Buildings, then cities, seem to shrink below, disappearing as you rise through clouds, going higher and higher into the darkness... and you keep going... until Earth looks like a giant ball in the distance. No, it's not the opening scene of a science fiction movie. It's a real experience that will soon be available to adventurous space tourists - thanks to a company called Space Perspective. Space Perspective will take passengers on a journey into the stratosphere.
You may have heard of other companies in the growing field of space tourism, such as Blue Origin or SpaceX, that offer short trips to space by rocket. However, Space Perspective uses a gigantic hydrogen-filled balloon! Large enough to contain an entire football stadium, the huge balloon is attached to a small, bowl-shaped capsule which it pulls through space at a speed of 19 kilometers an hour. According to Jane Poynter - one of Space Perspective founders - many people are nervous about traveling in a rocket, but are less worried by the quiet, soft motion of floating with a balloon.
A journey starts before sunrise, and lasts a total of six hours. Inside the capsule, called Spaceship Neptune, there is enough plush seating for eight "Explorers," plus an area with refreshments, and of course, a bathroom. The thrill begins during the two hours it takes for the balloon to gently lift the capsule into the Earth's stratosphere - 30 kilometers above the planet. Then, passengers have two hours to enjoy floating there, taking in the magnificent, unobstructed views through the large floor-to-ceiling windows. Explorers can even share their adventure on social media from the capsule! Then, Spaceship Neptune returns to Earth, where it lands in the Atlantic Ocean and is retrieved by a ship.
Are you a future space tourist? Although Space Perspective's flight sounds incredibly exciting, most of us won't be able to afford the $125,000 ticket. And some people aren't interested in space travel at all. According to a recent poll for example, 58% of Americans say they would not go into space if given the chance. What would you choose? Taking a ride in Spaceship Neptune or keeping both feet on the ground?

Do you dream about visiting space? Space tourism companies, such as Blue Origin and SpaceX send people to space with rockets. But some people are nervous about travelling by rocket. A new company called Space Perspective has a longer, gentler space flight planned. They are using a gigantic balloon instead! A small, bowl-shaped capsule is attached to the huge balloon. Moving at 19 kilometers an hour, the balloon pulls the capsule into Earth's stratosphere - 30 kilometers above the planet!
Space Perspective's capsule, called Spaceship Neptune, has enough room for eight passengers. Passengers sit in very comfortable seats while traveling. The capsule has refreshments, and there's a bathroom, too! Each flight lasts six hours. First, it takes two hours for the balloon to lift the capsule into the stratosphere. Then, passengers have two hours to enjoy space. They can see amazing views through the capsule's large floor-to-ceiling windows. Passengers can even share their adventure on social media from the capsule! Finally, Neptune takes two hours to return to Earth. It lands in the Atlantic Ocean, and is picked up by a ship.
Are you a future space tourist? Jane Poynter is one of Space Perspective's founders. She believes that people will be excited about the experience that her company offers. But most people can't afford the $125,000 ticket. And some people don't want to go to space at all. For example, a recent poll showed 58% of Americans would not go into space if they got the chance.

Do you want to be a space tourist? Blue Origin and SpaceX are companies for space tourists. They have rockets to travel to space. Another company, Space Perspective, doesn't have rockets. It will take tourists to space with a giant balloon! Space tourists sit in a big capsule under the balloon. Eight space tourists can travel in the capsule.
What happens on a Space Perspective trip? You travel slowly up, up, up into the sky. You pass the clouds. The sky gets dark. The Earth looks like a giant ball in the sky. Now, you are 30 kilometers above Earth. You look out the windows of the capsule. It's exciting to be there! You send messages to your friends with the Internet. Finally, it's time to return to Earth. The whole trip takes six hours.
Some people want to go to space. Some people feel nervous about it. Do you want to go? A ticket on Space Perspective costs $125,000. Is it worth it? You decide!




Technology Fights Loneliness
Science & Technology
The COVID-19 quarantine is making people feel lonely. And lonely people can get sick easily, especially seniors. Now, technology is helping seniors feel less lonely.
Deanna Dezern is 80 years old. She loves talking to ElliQ. ElliQ is a small robot. The robot talks to Dezern too, and tells jokes. Dezern says ElliQ makes her feel happy.
It's hard for seniors to be inside all the time. So, the company Rendever makes VR headsets. Seniors wear the headsets. Then, they "visit" places, like the Grand Canyon.
Technology helps people stay in touch. But many seniors are afraid of technology. KOMP helps. KOMP is a screen with just one button. Seniors push the button to turn the screen on. Then, family and friends can send messages and photos to the KOMP screen. They can also video chat with the senior.
Pets make people feel less lonely. But not all seniors can have pets. So, Ageless Innovation makes robot cats and dogs. The pets look and sound real. Some seniors think they're strange. Other seniors love them!

Technology Fights Loneliness
Science & Technology
Like many seniors around the world, 80-year-old Deanna Dezern, is self-isolating during the COVID-19 crisis. Self-isolating can make people feel lonely - but Dezern feels fine. Dezern has a new companion - ElliQ. ElliQ is a small, robot made specifically for seniors. It can do many things - answer questions, tell jokes, and manage Dezern's schedule. Research shows that loneliness is bad for us. It can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease. And feelings of loneliness have gone up because of the lack of socializing during the crisis. Now, ElliQ and other types of technology are helping seniors fight loneliness.
Having less freedom to go outside or move around makes seniors feel extra lonely. But VR (virtual reality) technology can help them "travel" to other places. Rendever is a company that makes VR headsets for seniors. With the headset, seniors can visit many places in the world, including the French countryside, or Yosemite National Park.
Many seniors find computers and other devices difficult to use. KOMP, a one-button computer, solves that problem. All seniors need to do is turn it on. Then, family and friends can send messages and photos. They can also start video chats. It all appears instantly on KOMP's screen.
Ageless Innovation has special pets just for seniors. The cats purr and the dogs wag their tails. But they're not real: they're robots! The robot pets react to voices and touch. Researchers at Florida Atlantic University say these pets make seniors feel less lonely. And there's no mess to clean up!
Hopefully, companies will continue to design products to help seniors live longer, happier and less lonely lives.

Technology Fights Loneliness

"Who talks to a lamp?" jokes 80-year-old Deanna Dezern, from Florida, USA. Dezern is referring to a small robot named ElliQ, made specifically for elderly adults. ElliQ keeps them from getting lonely by acting as a companion. The robot can answer questions, tell jokes, and even remind Dezern about doctors appointments. ElliQ is just one type of robot helping older people, like Dezern, feel less lonely during self-isolation.
There is nothing new about loneliness. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, over 9 million people in the UK reported feeling lonely. But recently, due to the lack of socializing during the pandemic, the problem has gotten worse.
Research shows that loneliness and social isolation are bad for our health, leading to serious problems such as heart disease, dementia, and strokes. Now, health officials all over the world are looking for ways to fight loneliness - especially within the elderly population. And technology is here to help!
Elderly people living in nursing homes often feel isolated since they lack freedom of movement. But VR (virtual reality) technology can help reduce this feeling. Rendever is a company that makes VR headsets for senior citizens. Seniors can put on a VR headset, and use Rendever's technology to "visit" the French countryside, Yosemite National Park, or other places around the world. "All of a sudden, life is much more than the four walls around you," says Rendever's CEO, Kyle Rand.
Besides having less freedom, many elderly people don't often see family and friends. Although technology helps people keep in touch, many older people find technology intimidating. KOMP, a one-button computer, solves that problem. All that seniors have to do is turn it on. Then, family and friends with more digital skills can start video chats, or send text messages and photos, which pop up on the KOMP screen.
Ageless Innovation provides special pets for seniors. The cats purr and the dogs wag their tails - but they're not real: they're robots! Using built-in technology, the pets react to voices and touch. Researchers at Florida Atlantic University have shown that these pets decrease social isolation for older adults. And there's no mess to clean up!
Hopefully, companies will continue to design products to help seniors live longer, happier and less lonely lives.





Have you seen the viral video of a boy preparing to enter a school in China during the COVID-19 crisis? There are several steps he has to take before entering the classroom. One of these steps is walking over to a friendly-looking robot, which checks his temperature and scans his face for signs of illness. Only after passing the robot's inspection does the boy walk into the classroom.
Robots are extremely helpful during the corona pandemic because they help lower the number of humans who need to be exposed to people with the virus. And so, robots are being used in a variety of ways all around the world.
Hospitals in Europe, India, and South Africa are using robots to do various tasks instead of staff, so staff can stay at a safe distance from patients. These tasks include everything from bringing patients their food to disinfecting hospital rooms. Robots also deliver medication to patients, and bring blood samples to laboratories. The Circolo Hospital in Varese, Italy, has a robot nurse named Tommy. Tommy stands next to the beds of some patients with COVID-19. It measures the patient's' blood pressure and lets patients use its tablet to communicate with nurses and doctors remotely.
Robots are being used to support public safety, too. Police in Dubai, UAE send drone robots flying through the streets, spraying disinfectant. A robot dog equipped with a camera and loudspeaker patrols Singapore parks, encouraging social distancing by broadcasting the message "Please stand at least one meter apart!"
Robots even attended a virtual graduation at Business Breakthrough University in Tokyo. Graduates watched the ceremony live using the video-conferencing program Zoom. A few robots, who had tablets instead of faces, were dressed in traditional graduation caps and gowns. When a student was called to come and receive his or her diploma, their face appeared on a robot's tablet. So, when the robot rolled over to "accept" the diploma from the university president (who was physically there) the graduate was virtually there to accept it.
And what's another benefit to using robots in the battle against Covid-19? When a robot gets tired, you just recharge it and send it back to work!

Schools in China are using robots to check students for signs of COVID-19. Before entering the classroom, the robot checks the child's temperature and scans their face for signs of illness. But China's schools aren't the only places using robots during the corona crisis. Robots are being used in many places around the world.
Hospitals are using robots to deliver medication to patients with COVID-19, and to bring blood samples to laboratories. Some robots sanitize hospital rooms.
Tommy, a robot nurse at a hospital in Italy, stands next to the beds of some patients with COVID-19. Tommy measures the patients' blood pressure and lets patients use its tablet to communicate with nurses and doctors remotely. Hospital robots help limit the amount of direct contact doctors and nurses have with COVID-19 patients.
In the US and UK, robots deliver food and other necessary items to people in quarantine. In Dubai, robots travel around the city spraying disinfectant. And a robot dog in Singapore reminds people in parks to "Please stand at least one meter apart!"
In Tokyo, Japan, robots even helped out at a virtual graduation. A few robots - with tablets for faces - attended the graduation ceremony in place of the graduates. The graduates watched the ceremony from home, using Zoom, a video-conferencing program. When a graduate was called up to receive their diploma, their face appeared on a robot's tablet. When the robot rolled over to receive the diploma, the graduate was there to accept it virtually!
What's another benefit to using robots in the fight against Covid-19? When robots get tired, you just recharge them and send them back to work!

Corona Robots
Science & Technology
Many countries are using robots during the corona crisis. The robots do many jobs that humans usually do. Robots can get very close to people with COVID-19, so humans don't have to.
Schools in China use robots to check schoolchildren for fever. In some hospitals in Europe and South Africa, robots clean patients' rooms. They bring patients medicine.
There is a robot nurse called Tommy. Patients use Tommy to talk to doctors and nurses who are in a different room.
Robots keep people safe outside, too. In Dubai, robots spray disinfectant to clean the air. In Singapore, a robot dog walks around parks. It reminds people to stand far from each other. In the UK and US, robots bring food and other important things to people who are stuck at home.
What's another thing that's good about robots? They don't need to sleep. When they get "tired" you just recharge them and send them back to work!




Gitanjali Rao: Teenage Scientist
Science & Technology
Gitanjali Rao is a teenager. Like other teenagers, she has a lot of hobbies. Rao plays the piano and guitar. She likes swimming, baking, and writing. But this teenager also loves science. Rao uses science to invent things. She won many science prizes. Rao won a big prize for the best young scientist - "America's Top Young Scientist." The prize was $25,000!
Rao makes inventions that help people. She heard about a place called Flint, Michigan, USA. The water there was too dangerous to drink. So, Rao invented Tethys. You put your water in a glass. Is the water safe to drink? Tethys checks the water. Then, you know. Another device Rao made helps people with snakebites.
What will Rao do next? After high school, she wants to study more science. "I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people... scientists do the same exact thing," she says.

Gitanjali Rao is a teenager with lots of hobbies. She plays the piano and guitar. She loves swimming, baking, and writing. She even wrote a book called Baby Brother Wonders when she was just nine years old! Rao is also an award-winning scientist and inventor.
"I have always loved to help other people," says Rao. She started inventing things in kindergarten. One of Rao's helpful inventions can check how bad a snake bite is. She also created an app to find cyberbullying messages online. Then, Rao heard about contaminated drinking water in a town called Flint, Michigan, USA. There was too much lead (a type of metal) in the water. So, Rao created Tethys. Tethys is a small device that tests for lead in drinking water. For her invention, Rao was named "America's Top Young Scientist" by a national science competition. The prize was $25,000! Rao is using the money to make Tethys ready to be sold in stores.
Rao has done many other interesting things. Thousands of people have seen her TEDx Talks on the Internet. She travels around the USA teaching children about the dangers of bullying. And recently, she was in a special article in Forbes magazine with 29 other amazing young people.
After high school, Rao hopes to study genetics. She believes in the power of science to solve problems. "I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people, and want to do what is best for their society; scientists do the same exact thing."

Gitanjali Rao is a teenager who lives in Colorado, USA. Like many teenagers, she has lots of hobbies and interests. She is an accomplished musician who plays the piano and bass guitar. She loves Indian classical dancing, singing, swimming, and baking. She even wrote and illustrated a book called Baby Brother Wonders when she was just nine years old! She is also an award-winning scientist and inventor.
Rao became interested in science at an early age, and began inventing things when she was in kindergarten. Her parents, who are engineers, encouraged her ideas and supported her in developing and building different projects. One of Rao's inventions, which detects poisonous snake bites, won her the honor of STEM Scout of the Year. When Rao realized her school had a cyberbullying problem, she created an app to detect cyberbullying messages.
When Rao was twelve, she heard on the news that people were getting sick from drinking the water in a town called Flint, Michigan, USA. There were dangerous amounts of lead (a type of metal) in the water. Conventional water testing, which would let people know if their water was safe to drink, took too long to get results. This led Rao to create Tethys - a small, mobile device that tests for lead in drinking water. For her work, Rao was named one of "America's Top Young Scientists" by a national youth science and engineering competition, and she received $25,000 in prize money! Rao is currently using her prize money to develop and produce Tethys commercially.
"I have always loved to help other people," says Rao. She has presented her ideas in TEDx talks, which thousands of people have viewed online. Additionally, Rao recently joined 29 other amazing young people on the "30 under 30" list of Forbes magazine. She also volunteers for an organization called Children's Kindness Network. Through this organization, Rao visits elementary schools to educate children about kindness and the dangers of bullying.
After high school, Rao hopes to study either genetics or epidemiology. She believes in the power of science to solve problems. "I think that being a scientist is like being a superhero, because superheroes save people, and want to do what is best for their society; scientists do the same exact thing."





"I could feel the music all over my body," said Kassandra Wedel, an audience member at a classical music performance. Kassandra is deaf. To "hear" the music, she wore a special shirt that let her feel vibrations and other sensations on different parts of her upper body. The shirt is a piece of wearable technology, called the SoundShirt.
How does the SoundShirt work? At a concert, microphones on stage pick up the sound from the musical instruments. The SoundShirt software analyzes the music and translates the sound into data, which is transmitted to the shirt. The shirt (made of comfortable, stretchy material) has 16 sensors, which vibrate with the music. Wearers can feel these vibrations on different parts of their body. They feel violin vibrations on their arms, for example, and drum vibrations on their backs. They also feel other sensations, like waves and pulses, flowing through the shirt.
SoundShirt was created by the company CuteCircuit in London, England. CuteCircuit based SoundShirt on a wearable device they developed in 2002, called the "HugShirt," which lets you to send the feeling of a hug to someone far away. In 2016, the Junge Symphoniker Orchestra in Hamburg, Germany, approached CuteCircuit. They asked the company to invent something similar that would make concerts accessible to audience members who are deaf. CuteCircuit took on the challenge.
CuteCircuit made a prototype and had deaf audience members test the shirt and give feedback. Based on their feedback, CuteCircuit created SoundShirt 2.0. Currently, the shirt is just being sold to concert halls, museums and other entertainment venues. But soon, they'll be available for purchase by individuals too, for about $3,600.
SoundShirt 2.0 was a hit with lifestyle and culture bloggers, Hermon and Heroda Berhane. The bloggers are twin sisters and are both deaf. The company Desperados organized a huge DJ dance party, and got SoundShirts for the Berhanes to wear. "To 'feel the music' was an emotional experience for us," said the sisters. They also said that wearing the shirts made them feel more included at the party. Although the SoundShirt is expensive, the twins say it's worth it for people who are hard-of-hearing but really love music.

"To 'feel the music' was an emotional experience for us," said lifestyle bloggers Hermon and Heroda Berhane. The twin sisters, who are deaf, recently tested a piece of wearable technology, called the SoundShirt. It let them "hear" music through vibrations and other sensations.
How does the SoundShirt work? At a classical music concert, microphones pick up the sound from the instruments. SoundShirt software then turns the sound into data, and sends it to the shirt. The shirt has 16 sensors. They let wearers feel vibrations on their skin. A person feels the vibrations on different parts of their body, depending on the instruments. For example, they feel violin vibrations on their arms, and drum vibrations on their backs.
The SoundShirt was created by the London-based company CuteCircuit. They created the SoundShirt with the help of the Junge Symphoniker Orchestra in Hamburg, Germany. The orchestra wanted to make their concerts accessible to people who are deaf, so they asked CuteCircuit to make one.
CuteCircuit first made prototypes of the SoundShirt. Then, they asked people who are deaf to test the shirt and give them feedback. CuteCircuit used this feedback to develop the final product, SoundShirt 2.0. Currently, the SoundShirt is being sold to venues, like concert halls, and museums. But they'll soon be available to individuals too, for about $3,600.
The Berhanes were given SoundShirts to wear at a huge dance party. The bloggers loved them. They said the shirts even made them feel more included. And although the SoundShirt is expensive, the Berhanes think it's worth it.

Feel the Music
Science & Technology
A woman is listening to an orchestra play. But the woman is deaf.  She doesn't hear the music. She feels the music! The woman is wearing a SoundShirt. The SoundShirt makes her feel vibrations when the music is playing. When violins play, she feels vibrations on her arms. When drums play, she feels vibrations on her back. The vibrations may be fast or slow. They may be strong or weak. It depends on the music.
An orchestra in Germany wanted people who are deaf to enjoy their concerts. So, they asked the company CuteCircuit to invent a special shirt. CuteCircuit invented the SoundShirt.
How does the SoundShirt work? Musicians play musical instruments. The music travels through microphones and into a computer. Computer software sends messages to the shirt. The messages tell the shirt what kind of vibrations to make. It tells them where to make the vibrations.
Orchestras are buying SoundShirts for people in the audience. Soon, individuals will be able to buy SoundShirts too.




Save the Ice!
Science & Technology
Glaciers and icebergs are huge pieces of ice. They float in cold ocean water. But the Earth is getting very hot. The heat is melting the ice. This is dangerous for the Earth. Scientists are trying to save the glaciers and icebergs - and save the Earth.
One idea is to make new ice. Submarines will fill up with water from the sea. The water will freeze inside the submarines. Small icebergs will come out of the submarines. The small icebergs will come together to make one large piece of ice.
People living near the Rh�ne Glacier, in Switzerland, want to save it. Every summer they cover the glacier with huge white blankets. The white color reflects sunlight. So, the glacier doesn't melt.
Ice911 is an organization in the US. Ice911 makes artificial snow out of tiny pieces of glass. Scientists spread the "snow" over the ice. The "snow" reflects sunlight. Now the sun can't melt the ice.
These are just some of the ways people are saving glaciers, icebergs, and the planet.

Save the Ice!
Science & Technology
Over the years, the Earth has been getting hotter. The planet's higher temperatures have been causing glaciers and icebergs to melt - which means long-term changes to the Earth's weather. As more and more Arctic sea ice disappears each year, scientists are working on ways to save the Arctic ice.
One idea, coming from a team of Indonesian designers, is to use submarines to make new ice. First, a submarine will dive into the sea and fill up with water. Then, the water will freeze, forming (after one month) a 5-meter-thick, 25-meter-wide iceberg. The iceberg, shaped like a hexagon, will float on the water. Many of these icebergs will then come together like a puzzle, to make one extremely large piece of ice.
Another method is already being used in Switzerland to save the Rh�ne Glacier in the Swiss Alps. Each summer, as the temperature rises, people from towns near the glacier cover it with huge white blankets. The blankets' white color reflects sunlight, so the ice doesn't melt. Scientist David Volken, who studies glaciers, believes this method may reduce melting by up to 70 percent.
Ice911 also wants to protect ice from the sun. This US organization created a type of artificial snow. The "snow" is actually microscopic glass balls. When this snow is spread over water and ice, it reflects the sunlight. This protects the ice, and keeps the water cool. Researchers found that ice covered in the artificial snow stayed thicker than uncovered ice.
These are just some ways people around the world are trying to save the Arctic ice. Saving the ice means a cooler planet for us all.

Save the Ice!
Science & Technology
It's no secret that our planet is heating up. As the Earth's temperature increases, melting glaciers and icebergs contribute to climate change - long-term shifts in the Earth's weather. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic sea ice has been thinning out over the last several decades at a "catastrophic" rate. Scientists have been searching for solutions to prevent or reverse this process. A variety of techniques are being developed to save the disappearing Arctic ice.
One idea for refreezing the melting ice sounds like science fiction. A team of Indonesian designers wants to use iceberg-making submarines to create new chunks of ice at the north and south poles. First, a submarine would dive down and fill up with seawater. After filtering out the salt, the water would freeze inside the submarine (a one-month process). Finally, a 5-meter-thick, 25-meter-wide hexagon-shaped iceberg would be sent out of the submarine to float on the water's surface. The designers believe the unique shape will help many small icebergs fit together like a puzzle, to form a very large ice mass.
Another technique is being used in Switzerland to save the Rh�ne Glacier in the Swiss Alps. This method uses an unexpected item - a blanket. Each summer, as the temperature rises, a group of citizens from the nearby Obergoms area cover the glacier with enormous white fleece blankets. The blankets' white color reflects light off the glacier, protecting it from the sun's rays. Swiss glaciologist David Volken believes this technique may reduce melting by up to 70 percent.
A new invention by the US based non-profit organization Ice911 also helps keep the sun off the ice. Ice911 has created a type of artificial snow made from microscopic glass balls. The "snow" can be spread over the water and existing ice, creating slush. Sunlight reflects off the slush instead of being absorbed by the ice and sea. Ice911 has been testing their invention for about ten years, and researchers have found that ice covered in the "snow" stayed thicker than uncovered ice.
These techniques are just some of the ways people around the world are trying to restore and protect the Arctic ice. Saving the ice means a cooler planet for us all.




A Helping Hand
Science & Technology
Argentine inventor Gino Tubaro always wanted to create things to help people. "From childhood, I started to imagine what I could invent with my ideas," he says. Tubaro became interested in 3D technology and built his first 3D printer at age sixteen to print out his inventions. Today, Tubaro's organization, Atomic Labs, runs a project called Limbs, which gives free 3D printed arms and hands to people - mostly children - who need them.
Tubaro's Limbs project began when he was still in high school. Tubaro received a message on social media from the mother of a boy born with only one hand. She didn't have enough money for a new artificial hand (they can cost as much as $15,000), and asked Tubaro to print one for her son, Felipe. In 2014, following a few months of trial and error, Tubaro sent Felipe the finished hand. Then, a video of Felipe using his new hand got a lot of attention on the Internet. "Tens of thousands of people saw the video we uploaded. After, many people wanted the prosthesis," says Tubaro.
How does the Limbs project work? Anyone with a 3D printer can sign up as a volunteer on Atomic Labs' Web site. Volunteers are paired with people in their area who have requested limbs. The volunteers are sent computer files for the design they will print. Each part of the prosthesis is printed with a biodegradable printing material called PLA, usually made from corn. The basic limb design is customized for each user, and can cost as little as $15 to make. Volunteers deliver the completed limbs directly to users. Atomic Labs also organizes events called Manot�ns, where users, their families, and volunteers get together to assemble the new limb. Children often request new limbs with superhero themes. One eight-year-old who likes Wonder Woman received a red and blue hand.
Today, Limbs has 1,400 volunteers in 44 countries. More than 500 people around the world, in places such as Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Thailand, have been given new prostheses - for free. Limbs has helped people from ages four to seventy, and Tubaro is excited that Limbs continues to expand. "Imagine what you can feel if you turn someone into superhero," he says.

How does Limbs work? Limbs connects someone who needs a prosthesis with volunteers in their area who have 3D printers. Limbs sends the volunteers the computer files they will need. Then, the volunteers print the prostheses. Prostheses users get their new limbs directly from volunteers, or at Manot�ns. Manot�ns are events where users and volunteers can build a new limb together. Many children ask for a hand that will make them feel like their favorite superhero. One eight-year-old Wonder Woman fan got a red and blue hand!
 
Limbs has already helped more than 500 people from the age of four to seventy, in places such as Argentina, Brazil, and Thailand. Tubaro is excited that Limbs continues to grow. "Imagine what you can feel if you turn someone into a superhero," he says.

Some people don't have a limb - such as a hand or an arm. They must use an artificial limb. But an artificial limb, called a prosthesis, costs a lot of money. It can cost $15,000. People don't always have $15,000 for a prosthesis. That's a big problem for them.
Gino Tubaro is an inventor. He wanted to help people get prostheses. In 2014, he started making prostheses with a 3D printer. Now, he helps people get free prostheses. How? There are volunteers all over the world with 3D printers. People without a limb meet with these volunteers. Then, the volunteers print 3D prostheses for them.
Sometimes, young children need a prosthesis. They often ask for special "superhero" colors. For example, one eight-year-old girl wanted to feel like Wonder Woman. She got a red and blue artificial hand!
Tubaro is very happy about helping people get a prosthesis. He already helped more than 500 people. "Imagine what you can feel if you turn someone into a superhero," he says.




Printing a Heart
Science & Technology
People use 3-D printers to print many things. Scientists at Israel's Tel Aviv University (TAU) just printed something amazing. They printed the first 3-D heart made of human tissue!
Scientists already use 3-D printers to make simple organs. But printing a heart is harder. A heart has many different parts. Professor Tal Dvir is the scientist in charge of TAU's project. He says TAU's heart is the first printed heart with cells and blood vessels. In fact, it has all the same parts as a human heart.
Thousands of people around the world need heart transplants. But there aren't enough donor hearts for everyone. If there are printed hearts, patients will not need donor hearts.
This first 3-D heart isn't ready for humans yet. But Dvir hopes it will be ready in ten years. Then, when a patient needs a new heart, scientists will just print them one!

Printing a Heart
Science & Technology
With today's 3-D printers, we can make many different objects. We can make shoes, food, and medical devices. Recently, scientists at Israel's Tel Aviv University (TAU) printed the world's first 3-D heart made of human tissue!
Scientists have already printed some organs and simple tissues. But a heart has many different parts, so printing one is more difficult. "People have managed to 3-D print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels," says Professor Tal Dvir, the project's lead researcher. TAU's 3-D heart has all the same sections as a human heart.
According to the American Heart Association, around 120 million adults in the USA have heart disease. Many of them need a heart transplant. But there aren't enough donor hearts available. In addition, patients often need to wait six months or more for a heart, but not everyone can survive that long. 3-D hearts would solve this problem; they could be created as needed. Also, the printed heart would use tissue taken from the patient, so there's less of a chance that the body would reject it. TAU researchers say that using a patient's own tissue to "print" the heart is necessary for its success.
This first 3-D heart isn't quite ready yet. First, scientists will need to "teach" the organ to work correctly. Next, they'll need to transplant it successfully into animals. Finally, the heart will be ready for humans to try. Dvir hopes that within ten years, 3-D hearts will be replacing organ donation and saving people's lives.

What can you make with a 3-D printer? Lots of things - from shoes to food to medical devices. And recently, scientists at Israel's Tel Aviv University (TAU) succeeded in printing the world's first 3-D heart made of human tissue!
Scientists have already printed some organs and simple tissues, but printing a heart is more challenging, because it's so complex. "People have managed to 3-D print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels," says Professor Tal Dvir, the project's lead researcher. The heart needs cells and blood vessels to help it work. TAU's 3-D heart has all the same chambers and blood vessels as a human heart. The "ink" used by the 3-D heart printer came from a variety of biological molecules, and included tissues taken from human test subjects. And although this heart is small (only about the size of a rabbit's heart), Dvir says the same technology could be used to create a human-sized heart.
According to a recent report from the American Heart Association, around 120 million adults in the USA suffer from heart disease. For those with seriously damaged hearts, a transplant is their only hope. But the supply of donor hearts is limited, and patients can wait six months or more until a heart is available. Unfortunately, not all patients survive the wait. 3-D hearts would solve this problem, as they could be created as needed. And the 3-D printed heart would use tissue taken from the person having the transplant, to decrease the chances that their body would reject it. TAU researchers say that using a patient's own tissue is vital to the success of the printed heart.
This first 3-D heart isn't ready for humans - yet. During the next stages of research, scientists will have to teach the organ to "behave" like a heart, then transplant 3-D printed hearts into animals to make sure they function correctly. Finally, the hearts will be ready for humans to try. Dvir hopes that within ten years, 3-D printed hearts will eliminate the need for organ donation.




A First for Beth Moses
Science & Technology
Beth Moses returned from space awestruck. "It was just beautiful. It was the most amazing thing!" she exclaimed. The aerospace engineer had just returned from an incredible journey, becoming the first woman to fly to space on a commercial spacecraft.
"Ever since I was a child I wanted to go to space," says Moses. Her parents took her to science museums and encouraged her interest. She studied, worked hard, and became a NASA engineer. But like most people in the aerospace industry, she never actually got to be an astronaut. In a 2017 interview, Moses explained that going to space was extremely competitive and that her eyesight wasn't good enough for NASA's requirements. "I haven't gone [to space] yet, but I have my fingers crossed that I'll get to go one day."
After Moses began working at a commercial spacecraft company, space travel was finally within her reach, and she achieved her dream in February, 2019. During her historic flight, Moses and two pilots flew to a height of 89.9 kilometers. Once in space, Moses took off her safety belt and began floating around the spacecraft. She floated to the windows where she could marvel at the earth below. Then, she walked along the ceiling "like Spider-Man" to the back of the spacecraft, before eventually returning to her seat and putting her safety belt back on.
The company Moses works for is Virgin Galactic, which plans to make flights available to "space tourists". Virgin's SpaceShipTwo spacecraft, which is designed to carry six astronauts and two pilots, has more windows than any other spaceship in history, providing spectacular views. The $250,000 tickets are beyond most people's budget, but cost a lot less than the tens of millions of dollars paid by the first space tourist to the International Space Station in 2001. As Virgin Galactic's Chief Astronaut Instructor, Moses is responsible for the training customers must undergo before their flights. The firsthand encounter that Moses had in the passenger seat will help her ensure her trainees can savor their experience.
So, what advice does the 571st human to travel into space have for fellow dreamers? "Never give up, and you will achieve the impossible, and then others will follow," says Moses.

A First for Beth Moses

"It was just beautiful. It was the most amazing thing!" Beth Moses exclaimed. Moses had just returned from a historic flight as the first woman to fly to space in a commercial spacecraft.
"Ever since I was a child, I wanted to go to space," says Moses. She studied and worked hard to become a NASA engineer. However, like most engineers at NASA, Moses didn't get to be an astronaut. Then, when she began working at a commercial spacecraft company, Moses finally got her chance to go to space.
Moses's dream came true in February, 2019 while working for the spacecraft company, Virgin Galactic. Together with two pilots, she flew to a height of 89.9 kilometers above Earth. In space, Moses took off her safety belt, floated around the spacecraft, and admired the view of Earth. She also walked on the ceiling of the spacecraft before she returned to her seat and put her safety belt on again.
Virgin Galactic plans to take "space tourists" on flights in a spacecraft called SpaceShipTwo. The spacecraft can carry six passengers and two pilots. Tickets cost $250,000, but that's much less than earlier space flights. The first space tourist paid millions of dollars to visit the International Space Station in 2001.
Moses is Chief Astronaut Instructor at Virgin Galactic, and she helps customers get ready for their flights. Now that Moses has been to space, she'll use her knowledge to make the experience memorable for Virgin Galactic's passengers.

Today, Virgin Galactic is planning flights to space for "space tourists". The tickets cost a lot of money - $250,000! Before space tourists fly, Moses helps them get ready for their flight. She hopes they will also say, "It was the most amazing thing!"





Do you play virtual reality (VR) video games? Put on a VR headset, and you feel like you're inside the game. But VR can help people in other ways, too. VR can help people who have phobias, very strong fears.
There are many kinds of phobias. Some people have a fear of flying. Some have a fear of spiders. Some have a fear of dogs. Many people have acrophobia, a fear of heights.
Therapists help people with phobias. If someone has acrophobia, the therapist might have them stand on a high balcony. There, the person slowly learns to be less afraid.
Today, many therapists use VR to help people with phobias. With VR, you don't need to go to a high balcony. You just put on a VR headset. Then, it looks and feels like you're on a high balcony. But you're really in the therapist's office.
The idea to use VR for phobias isn't new. People thought of this idea 20 years ago. But now, we finally have the technology to make it work.

Have No Fear, VR is Here!
Science & Technology
Have you ever played virtual reality (VR) video games? VR creates imaginary worlds that feel completely real to the player. But VR has other uses, too. VR can help people overcome many phobias, such as fear of heights, fear of flying, or fear of dogs.
"Exposure therapy" is a common treatment for phobias. In traditional exposure therapy, a therapist slowly exposes the patient to what they fear. For example, a therapist might take a patient with a fear of heights, or acrophobia, to a balcony on a high floor of a building. There, the therapist will talk to the patient and help them deal with their anxiety.
Today, with virtual reality technology, there is a new kind of exposure therapy - VR exposure therapy. In VR therapy, instead of actually going to the balcony of a building, the patient puts on a VR headset. To the patient, it looks and feels like they're on the balcony of a tall building. But they're really still in the therapist's office.
Researchers have been exploring the use of VR with phobias for about 20 years. But only now, with advanced cell phone and gaming technologies, has VR exposure therapy become practical and affordable. And VR therapy continues to advance. Soon, people might be able to work with a virtual therapist or coach when they're doing VR exposure therapy. In a University of Oxford study, Dick Tracey, a man with acrophobia, tried VR therapy with a virtual coach instead of a human therapist. After only seven sessions, Tracey was able to stand on the roof of his house. "I would never have dreamed of doing that before," says Tracey.

Have you ever played a virtual reality (VR) game? You put on a VR headset, and suddenly, you're in an imaginary world that feels just like real life. But VR has other uses, too. VR can help people overcome phobias, such as fear of heights, fear of flying, or fear of dogs.
Phobia sufferers do everything possible to avoid situations that might trigger their phobia. This has a negative impact on their lifestyle, limiting where and how they live, work, and play. For instance, people who are afraid of dogs may avoid walking through parks, where people commonly walk their dogs.
For years, mental health professionals have been treating people with phobias using "exposure therapy". Traditional exposure therapy exposes the patient to the object or situation they fear, in a gradual way, and in a safe environment. For example, a therapist may take a patient with acrophobia, a fear of heights, to a balcony on a high floor of a building. There, the therapist supports the patient, talking them through their anxiety.

But they're actually still in the therapist's office.
Using VR to treat phobias isn't a new concept; researchers have been exploring the idea for about 20 years. But recent cell phone and video gaming technology has made VR therapy more practical and affordable than ever before. "The technology is finally catching up with the vision," says Albert Rizzo, a psychologist and VR researcher at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, USA.
As VR therapy continues to advance, human therapists may become unnecessary. In a University of Oxford study, Dick Tracey, a 62-year-old man with acrophobia, tried VR therapy with a virtual coach. After only seven VR sessions, Tracey was able to stand on the roof of his house. "I would never have dreamed of doing that before," said Tracey. "I now know how much the fear of heights restricted my everyday life."




Are You Ready for This Jelly?
Environment
You may have seen videos of jellyfish swimming in the ocean. Jellyfish are sea creatures that look like floating plastic bags, or umbrellas, with long, flowing tentacles. Jellyfish use venom in their tentacles to catch food. Lately, the number of jellyfish has been increasing in oceans across the globe. Though scientists aren't sure why this is happening, many are concerned. To them, too many jellyfish in the oceans is bad news. One interesting solution to this problem is encouraging people to eat the jellyfish!
Eating jellyfish is nothing new. For thousands of years, dishes made with jellyfish have been popular in Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Vietnam. However, in Europe and other parts of the world, jellyfish is an unfamiliar food. Biologist Antonella Leone at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) wants to change that. She says that jellyfish are low in calories and fat too, and can be a healthy addition to a person's diet. They are also a good source of protein. Out of the (approximately) 4,000 species of jellyfish worldwide, at least 30 of them are edible.
Leone has been studying jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea for more than 10 years. It's a region where the increase in jellyfish has been a huge problem. One reason is that large groups, or "swarms," of jellyfish have destroyed fish farms, causing owners to lose money. Another reason is that beaches have had to close to protect swimmers from jellyfish stings. Jellyfish stings are often extremely painful and can make humans sick; some stings can even be deadly.
Leone and other scientists at the CNR are researching ways to make jellyfish tasty. So far, they have worked with chefs to turn dried, fresh, and frozen jellyfish into appetizing foods, including desserts, salads, and seasonings. Chef Fabiano Viva, of the restaurant Duo, in Lecce, Italy, has used jellyfish in soups and pasta sauces. He's also made jellyfish taste like French fries. Leone has collected some of the chefs' best recipes so far and turned them into a book called European Jellyfish Cookbook.
And how does jellyfish taste? As one satisfied customer put it, "It tastes like the sea!"

Have you ever seen jellyfish? These sea creatures look like floating plastic bags with tentacles. The tentacles help jellyfish catch food. Around 4,000 types of jellyfish live in the world's oceans. Lately, scientists have become concerned. Many scientists believe there are just too many jellyfish. And the problem is getting worse. One interesting solution to the jellyfish problem is encouraging people to eat them!
At least 30 types of jellyfish can be eaten. In fact, eating jellyfish is already popular in Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and Vietnam. However, in many other parts of the world, jellyfish aren't considered food. Biologist Antonella Leone wants to change that. Leone has been researching jellyfish for more than 10 years. She wants more people to eat jellyfish. She adds that they are low in calories and fat, and have a lot of protein.
Leone studies jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea, where the number of jellyfish has been increasing. There, large groups, or "swarms," of jellyfish have destroyed fish farms, so the farm owners lose money. And when swarms get close to a beach, it's dangerous for swimmers. Jellyfish stings hurt! And the venom in their tentacles can make humans sick. So, many Mediterranean beaches have had to close.
To try to make jellyfish tasty, Leone works with chefs. They experiment with dried, fresh and frozen jellyfish. So far, the chefs have made soups, salads, pasta sauces, desserts, and other jellyfish dishes. Some chefs make jellyfish taste like French fries. Leone put the chefs' best recipes she found in a book called the European Jellyfish Cookbook. How does jellyfish taste? "Like the sea!" says one happy customer.

Jellyfish are sea animals. They have long tentacles. In many Asian countries, people eat jellyfish. People eat jellyfish in places like Japan, China, and Vietnam. Jellyfish are a healthy food. They don't have a lot of calories or fat. And they have a lot of protein.
In Europe, most people don't eat jellyfish. But Antonella Leone wants Europeans to start eating jellyfish. Leone is a biologist. She wants people to eat jellyfish because there are too many jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea. The jellyfish sting people in the water. (It really hurts!) So, many beaches need to close. Jellyfish also destroy fish in fish farms in the Mediterranean Sea. This is bad for businesses.
Leone wants to make jellyfish tasty. Then, people will eat it. So, Leone asked chefs to cook jellyfish. The chefs made soups, salads, and desserts with the jellyfish.

There is too much trash in the oceans. A lot of the trash is old shoes. Most shoe companies use plastic and rubber to make their shoes. These materials last a long time - too long. They take a long time to break up and go back into the environment (or "biodegrade"). Some shoes don't biodegrade at all. They just stay in the oceans and on the beaches. This is bad for the environment. But now, there is a company called Blueview. Blueview makes eco-friendly shoes.
Blueview uses plants to make their shoes. They use algae to make the bottom of the shoes. They use hemp plants and eucalyptus plants to make the top of the shoes. Because the shoes are from plants, they biodegrade quickly. But they are also strong. You can wear the shoes for as long as you want. When you are ready to throw them away, put them in a compost bin. The shoes will biodegrade in less than a year!

Goodbye Plastic, Hello Algae!
Environment
Stephen Mayfield is a biologist at the University of California, San Diego, in the USA. He researches ways to protect the oceans from plastic pollution. One cause of ocean pollution is shoes. Shoes litter beaches across the globe. In the USA alone, nearly 300 million shoes are thrown away each year. And most of these shoes don't biodegrade completely, or at all. Those that do, biodegrade slowly. So, Mayfield, along with a team of scientists, invented a shoe that is 100% biodegradable and biodegrades quickly.
The shoe company is Blueview. And Mayfield is its CEO. Blueview shoes are made entirely of plants, so they are eco-friendly. Mayfield and the Blueview scientists spent more than six years developing the sole of the shoe, which is made from algae. Next, they created a natural fabric for the top of the shoe, made of hemp and eucalyptus plants. Blueview's shoe, a flat sneaker called Pacific, comes in a several colors.
Typical shoes are made with leather, plastic, or rubber. These materials biodegrade slowly. For example, it can take 1000 years for some plastic to biodegrade. But since Pacifics are made with all natural materials, they biodegrade in less than a year! Pacifics are still strong, however, so you can treat them like any other shoes. You can even wash them in a washing machine! But when you're done with the shoes, don't throw them in the trash. Put them in a compost bin, so they'll biodegrade properly.
Mayfield is excited about the future. "If we can make our shoes the top-selling shoes in the world, every single brand will switch to this material - that is my dream."

Goodbye Plastic, Hello Algae!
Environment
Stephen Mayfield is a surfer, who's concerned for the ocean's health. He is also a biology professor at the University of California, San Diego. Mayfield researches ways to protect the oceans and our planet from plastic pollution. A lot of plastic waste comes from shoes that show up in rivers and on beaches across the globe. In the USA alone, nearly 300 million shoes are thrown away each year. And they don't biodegrade completely - or at all. Those that do biodegrade, do so very slowly. So, Mayfield, along with a team of scientists, created a plant-based shoe that's been proven to be 100 percent biodegradable. And it biodegrades quickly! The shoe company is called Blueview, and Mayfield is its CEO!
At Blueview, scientists built their biodegradable shoes from the bottom up. First, they spent more than six years developing material for the sole (the bottom of the shoe). They invented a special foam made from algae. Algae are simple plants that have no roots, and grow in water or other wet places. Next, for the top of the shoe the scientists created an organic fabric made of hemp and eucalyptus plants. The flat sneaker, called Pacific, comes in a variety of colors.
Typically, shoes are made with materials like leather, plastic, or rubber, which take a long time to biodegrade. For example, leather, a common shoe material, takes about 40 years to biodegrade. And plastic can stick around the planet for hundreds of generations. But because Pacifics are made of algae and other organic material, they can biodegrade in less than a year. Algae also absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which further reduces pollution. The scientists designed Blueview shoes to be durable, so you can treat them like any other shoe. You can even wash them in a washing machine when they get dirty! But don't simply throw the shoes in the trash when they wear out. Put them in a compost bin, so they can biodegrade properly.
Mayfield hopes Blueview shoes will also inspire other companies to use more eco-friendly materials. "If we can make our shoes the top-selling shoes in the world," he says, "every single brand will switch to this material - that is my dream."




Music Power
Environment
Imagine you're at an outdoor rock concert. Music booms through massive speakers, and lights flash over the stage. The crowd sings and moves, as the musicians perform on stage and on gigantic video screens. Performing in front of tens of thousands of people with so much equipment requires an enormous amount of power. And many bands today are trying to figure out how to power their concerts in more sustainable ways.
To produce large amounts of energy, many bands use diesel generators, which create electricity. According to a 2019 report, the UK entertainment industry uses around 100 million gallons of diesel each year to power events. But burning diesel causes pollution.
Performers are becoming aware of how their concerts affect the environment, and some are making changes. On a recent concert tour, Danish singer Lukas Graham decided to use "green" batteries. Instead of generators, he used a wind farm to charge the eco-friendly batteries before each concert. Graham doesn't miss the noisy generators or smell of burning diesel, and is excited about making concerts more sustainable.
British band Coldplay is also trying to make their concerts more environmentally friendly. They have special "kinetic" dance floors. As the music plays, fans jump and dance on these floors. Special technology converts this movement into electricity, helping to power the concert. The band also has about 15 stationary bikes, which produce energy as fans pedal. Each bike produces around 200 watts of energy. The amount of electricity generated through movement is not enough to power the whole concert, of course. But the band says their main goal is to raise awareness of the importance of creating sustainable energy.
Concerts aren't the only places where you'll see "pedal power." Rock the Bike is a company in Oakland, California, that rents out stationary bikes for various events. Their bikes are used to generate electricity for everything - from charging phones to powering blenders to make smoothies.
More and more event organizers are taking measures to make their events more sustainable, providing fun while reducing their carbon footprint. In fact, Coldplay makes sure that even the confetti they use is biodegradable. And, as Lukas Graham says, "It's the little things that make a big difference."

Music Power
Environment
Outdoor musical performances are exciting. There can be tens of thousands of fans. As the musicians play, the music comes out of huge speakers. There are large video screens and many bright lights. All this equipment uses a lot of electricity. The electricity is produced by generators. However, generators can be noisy and bad for the environment. Most generators run on diesel fuel, and burning diesel creates pollution. So today, performers are looking for more eco-friendly ways to help power their concerts.
Lukas Graham is a singer from Denmark. At a recent concert, Graham used special batteries for his equipment. The batteries weren't charged by generators. They were charged by wind turbines. Wind turbines are tall structures with blades that use wind to create electricity. Graham is proud that his concerts are becoming more eco-friendly.
The British band Coldplay is also making their concerts "greener." At Coldplay shows, fans can help create energy for the concert. They can jump and dance on "kinetic" dance floors or ride a stationary bike. Special technology converts fans' movements into electricity.
Stationary bikes aren't just for concerts, either. Many event organizers today want their events to be fun and eco-friendly. They can rent stationary bikes from companies like Rock the Bike, which can power everything from speakers to blenders, to make smoothies!
These may be small steps in the process of making events more sustainable, but as Lukas Graham says, "It's the little things that make a big difference."

Large outdoor concerts are fun. But they also use a lot of electricity. These concerts have large speakers. They have bright lights. You can see the musicians on very large screens. How do bands get all the electricity they need? They use generators. Most generators need diesel fuel to work. Diesel fuel creates pollution. But today, many musicians want their concerts to be "green." They want to find other ways to make electricity.  
Lukas Graham is a singer from Denmark. Graham doesn't use diesel generators. Graham uses a wind turbine. It turns wind into electricity. This saves a energy.
Coldplay is a British band. At Coldplay concerts, people help make electricity! How? By moving! The band has a special dance floor and stationary bikes. Fans dance on the dance floor. Other fans ride the bikes. When they move, they make energy. Technology changes the energy into electricity.
Today, more and more musicians are fans of "green" concerts.




A Different Kind of Vacation
Environment
People like going on vacation. They like to see new places and do fun things. But some people also want to help the places they visit. These travelers can take a regenerative vacation. On a regenerative vacation, you can help wild animals. You can work on a farm. You can clean up after a flood.
First Nature Treks and Tours is a travel company. They plan regenerative vacations. One vacation is in a forest in Oregon, USA. A fire destroyed a lot of trees. Now you can go to the forest and plant new trees.
Do you want to help animals? Hands Up Holidays will plan your regenerative vacation. You can go to Sydney, Australia. There, you can help kangaroos, wallabies, and wombats. You can help scientists get information about the animals. You can check to see if the water is safe for the animals to drink.
Regenerative vacations are "green." They are good for the environment. Regenerative travelers want to make the world a better place.

A Different Kind of Vacation
Environment
Are you looking for a new kind of vacation? You can try regenerative tourism. Regenerative tourism is about leaving the place you visit in better condition than the way you found it. Regenerative travelers spend their vacations improving the places they visit. They may work in areas damaged by fires, floods, or pollution. They may work on animal conservation projects, or help farmers. Regenerative tourists also meet with people from the local community. They learn about the area, and the people who live there.
One travel company offering regenerative tourism is Road Scholar. They run trips to Chincoteague Island in Virginia, USA. For one week, travelers help restore the island. This may include cleaning up beaches or building walkways. One Road Scholar regenerative tourist, Jean Carideo, helped remove harmful barbed wire from the island so it wouldn't hurt the ponies living there. Road Scholar's regenerative tourists also learn about Chincoteague Island's music and culture.
First Nature Treks and Tours is another company offering regenerative travel. They take tourists on three-day trips through Willamette National Forest in Oregon, USA. Tourists help by planting trees and fixing ruined hiking trails. After work, travelers meet with local citizens to learn about the area.
Hands Up Holidays offers many regenerative tours. On one trip, tourists go to the Blue Mountains near Sydney, Australia. They help animals, such as kangaroos, wallabies, and wombats. They may pick up fallen branches, or help researchers by collecting information about the animals.
Regenerative tourism is becoming more and more popular. "It's one thing to read, see, or hear about an ecological danger," says Carideo, "but it's another to physically do something about it."

A Different Kind of Vacation
Environment
Chincoteague Island in Virginia, USA, gets tens of thousands of visitors each year. Most come to observe and photograph the famous wild Chincoteague ponies. Tourists also enjoy exploring the island, and wandering through the shops and art galleries on historical Main Street. A few years ago, Jean Carideo went on a one-week vacation to Chincoteague Island. But instead of just watching the ponies, Carideo helped protect them. She worked for hours each day to improve the ponies' habitat by removing harmful barbed wire from the island. Carideo was taking part in regenerative tourism.
To "regenerate" means to regrow, or bring back something that was lost. Regenerative travelers actively participate in improving the place they visit, often bringing it back to the way it was. Travelers work on conservation projects, such as helping farmers, or doing restoration work in areas affected by fires, floods, and pollution. Regenerative travelers also interact with people from the community to learn about the region and its inhabitants.
Road Scholar, the travel company that ran Carideo's vacation, is one of many offering regenerative travel. Another company is First Nature Treks and Tours, which started offering three-day trips to the Willamette National Forest in Oregon, USA, after it lost 173,000 acres of trees in a forest fire. In the mornings, travelers plant trees, or restore hiking and biking trails. In the afternoons, they go mountain biking, rafting, or do other recreational activities. Then, they meet with local citizens to hear stories, and learn about the area.
With travel company Hands Up Holidays, tourists discover new places while strengthening their connection to nature. One tour takes visitors to the Blue Mountains near Sydney, Australia. For around five hours a day, participants do conservation activities to help kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, and other wildlife. They may pick up fallen branches, or help researchers by collecting data on different species in the area.
Today, more and more travel companies are offering travelers the opportunity to improve the world through regenerative tourism. "It's one thing to read, see, or hear about an ecological danger," says Carideo "but it's another to physically do something about it."




Secrets of the Seine
Environment
The citizens of Paris, "the city of love," have not always been very "loving" towards the Seine! Through the years, this famous river has become dirty and polluted. Over 2 million cubic meters of waste is dumped into the Seine every year. But 11-year-old Raphael is on a mission to help reduce the river's pollution.
Young Raphael spends most weekends "fishing" in the Seine. But he's not looking for fish � he's looking for trash! Raphael fishes metal objects out of the river. "I feel like I'm doing something for the planet in my own little way," he says.
To pull up the metal, Raphael uses a hook and a special magnet attached to a rope. The magnet can lift objects weighing up to 907 kilograms. Along with discarded bits of metal, Raphael pulls up objects like shopping carts, cell phones, scooters, and bicycles. One day, Raphael pulled a total of 20 bicycles out of the river! Another time, he found a rocket from World War II!
Raphael keeps some of the more unusual metal objects he finds, displaying them in a small museum he created in his basement at home. Examples include a camera, jewelry, and even a 19th-century bayonet! In 2021, Raphael's favorite pieces were exhibited in a pop-up museum in Paris. Raphael said he hoped the museum would raise awareness and encourage others to fight pollution.
Raphael's father, Alexandre, is not surprised by his son's hobby. "Raphael has always been close to nature and animals, so if someone does something bad to nature, like polluting it, he will, of course, step in." During the two years Raphael has been fishing in the Seine, he's removed over 18,000 kilograms of scrap metal. "At first, it was just meant to be a leisurely weekend activity," says Raphael. "But once I saw just how much debris there was buried at the bottom of the river, it became like a full-time job." In October 2020, Raphael was awarded the Medal of Paris, a prize given to people who have accomplished something significant for the city.
Raphael hopes to be one of the first to swim in the Seine once it's safe. Meanwhile, he'll continue fishing!

Eleven-year-old Raphael is on a mission. He wants to help reduce waste in the Seine. The Seine is a famous river in Paris. It is also very dirty and polluted. During his free time, Raphael fishes for metal objects people have thrown into the river.
To pull up the metal, Raphael uses a rope with a magnet and hook. The magnet can lift objects weighing up to 907 kilograms. Sometimes Raphael pulls up small pieces of metal. Other times he finds small items, like jewelry, cameras, and cell phones. But he also finds large objects, such as shopping carts, scooters, and bicycles. One day, Raphael pulled 20 bicycles out of the river! Raphael finds old objects too. He once found a weapon, called a bayonet, which was more than 200 years old!

Raphael is 11 years old. He lives in Paris. Raphael goes fishing. But he doesn't catch fish. Raphael catches metal objects!
Every weekend, Raphael goes to the Seine. The Seine is a river in Paris. The Seine is very dirty. People throw objects into the river. Many objects are metal. Raphael cares about nature. He wants to clean the Seine. So, he pulls the metal objects out of the river.
Raphael uses a magnet on a rope. The magnet is very strong. It can lift up to 907 kilograms! Raphael puts the magnet in the water. He uses the rope to pull up the metal objects.
Raphael finds small pieces of metal. He finds cell phones and shopping carts. Raphael also finds jewelry, cameras, scooters, and bicycles. Once, Raphael found a very old knife. It was from the 1800s!
Raphael took 18,000 kilograms of metal out of the Seine so far. He is happy to help the environment. "I feel like I'm doing something for the planet in my own little way," says Raphael.




Fabulous Fabric Scraps
Environment
There are thousands of fashion companies in the world. Many are in New York City, USA. The fashion companies use lots of fabric. But they don't use all the fabric. They throw away the fabric they don't need. This fabric goes into landfills. This is bad for the environment. But the company FABSCRAP is helping.
FABSCRAP gives bags to the fashion companies. The companies fill the bags with fabrics they don't need. Then FABSCRAP takes the bags.
At the FABSCRAP offices, volunteers take out all the fabric. They sort the pieces of fabric. They also take off tags, pins, staples, zippers, or buttons that are on the fabric.
FABSCRAP sells a lot of these fabric scraps. They sell the scraps in their thrift shops and online. Their prices are very low. FABSCRAP also recycles some fabric scraps. They shred the scraps. Companies can use the shredded scraps to make new things.
 
FABSCRAP was a success in New York City, So, they opened another FABSCRAP in Philadelphia, USA. Surely there will be many more.

Fabulous Fabric Scraps
Environment
New York City is known for many things, such as fashion. There are hundreds of fashion companies in the city. But making clothes makes lots of waste. This is a problem for the environment. One non-profit company is working on a solution.
When creating clothing, designers need to try many different textiles to see which work best. They cut up the textiles, but don't use them all. A lot of fabric is wasted. Then, it's thrown into landfills or burned. This harms the environment. But Jessica Schreiber thought of a plan. She started a non-profit company called FABSCRAP.
FABSCRAP collects textile scraps from hundreds of clothing companies. Then, volunteers sort and organize the scraps. They also take off any tags, pins, paper, staples, tape, zippers, or buttons. Finally, FABSCRAP either recycles the fabric or makes it available to people to reuse.
FABSCRAP sells the reusable scraps at low prices. They have an online store and thrift shops. Artists, crafters, sewers, and fashion students come to buy the scraps. And FABSCRAP volunteers receive two kilograms of free fabric as "payment" for their help. Textiles that are being recycled are shredded. The shredded fabric is called "shoddy." Shoddy can be used to fill mattresses and other products.
So far, FABSCRAP has kept almost 500,000 kilograms of used fabric out of landfills. Since they've been so successful in New York, FABSCRAP recently opened a second location, in Philadelphia, USA. And this is only the beginning. Schreiber hopes to help the whole fashion industry become more environmentally friendly.

Fabulous Fabric Scraps
Environment
New York City, USA, is one of the fashion capitals of the world. Hundreds of fashion companies call this glamorous city home. But unfortunately, lots of fashion means lots of waste. This is where FABSCRAP comes into the picture.
 
Fashion designers are constantly working with different textiles, and end up with large quantities of unused, leftover pieces of fabric. Globally, about 48 million metric tons of textiles are used to create clothing each year, and about 12% of that is wasted during design and production. Around 181,000 metric tons of fabric are thrown away in New York City alone. Most of it is burned or put in landfills.
The non-profit company FABSCRAP is working to solve this problem. FABSCRAP was founded in 2016 by Jessica Schreiber, who, while running a recycling project for New York City, saw how much fabric was going to waste.
FABSCRAP collects textile scraps from hundreds of clothing design companies. It recycles them or makes them available for individuals to buy and reuse. After signing up for the service, a company receives two kinds of bags. Brown bags are for textiles that can be reused, resold, or recycled. Black bags are for special textiles the company only wants recycled. FABSCRAP picks up the filled bags and brings them to their facilities. At FABSCRAP, volunteers sort and organize the scraps based on fiber content. They also remove tags, pins, paper, staples, tape, zippers, and buttons. Volunteers "earn" two kilograms of free fabric for their work.
The textiles that need to be recycled are shredded. The shredded material, called "shoddy," is used to make many other products, such as insulation, carpet padding, and mattress stuffing. The textiles that can be reused are sold at low prices online and in FABSCRAP's thrift shops. The shops are open to the public, making the materials available to artists, crafters, sewers, and fashion students.
So far, FABSCRAP has saved almost 500 metric tons of fabric from being thrown into landfills. And since the company was successful in New York, they recently opened a facility in Philadelphia, USA. But they're not stopping there. Schreiber wants to change the way the entire fashion industry deals with its waste.




Build Your House With Coffee!
Environment
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages on the planet, with around 10 percent of the world's coffee coming from Colombia. But to produce coffee, the coffee beans are separated from their husks, creating organic waste. In Colombia, tons of husks are dumped into landfills or burned each year; this is bad for the environment. Another problem Colombia is facing is a housing shortage. What do these two problems have in common? They are both being solved at once, by a Colombian construction company called Woodpecker. Woodpecker is using recycled coffee waste to build low-cost houses!
Woodpecker has been working on creating eco-friendly building materials for around 10 years. While developing their special lumber, they tried out different kinds of natural fibers, including rice, grass and sawdust. Finally, they chose coffee. "Coffee husk was selected because it's stronger and drier than the other fibers," says Alejandro Franco, Woodpecker's CEO.
To make their lumber, Woodpecker combines powdered coffee husks with recycled plastic. The mixture is used to form boards that look just like pieces of cut wood. Besides being durable and eco-friendly, Woodpecker's lumber is lightweight and easy to transport. This is very important because many of the people in Colombia who need housing live in rural, remote places. Building materials need to be light enough to be moved to isolated areas by small boat, helicopter, or donkey.
Once the materials arrive, it's time to start building. Most often, Woodpecker builds the homes, which can cost customers as little as $4,500 dollars. But the company also sells prefab kits, so people can build their houses themselves. The kits come with a steel frame and coffee husk lumber that fit together easily. It usually takes less than a week to construct a home. They come in different colors, and don't even need to be painted! More than 3,000 of the environmentally-friendly structures have been built in low-income areas of Colombia so far.
In the future, Woodpecker wants to add other features to its houses, including solar panels. The company also hopes to make their affordable homes available worldwide. "People, at the start, are a little skeptical that a house can be made of coffee," says Franco. But in the end, they are pleasantly surprised.

Build Your House With Coffee!
Environment
Around 10 percent of the world's coffee comes from Colombia. But coffee production is harming Colombia's environment. To produce coffee, the coffee beans are taken out of their husks. This creates tons of waste. The husks either go into landfills, or get burned. Colombia also has another problem - a housing shortage. How are these two problems connected? A Colombian company, called Woodpecker, is solving both problems at once. Woodpecker is building low-cost houses made from recycled coffee husks!
To build these homes, Woodpecker uses special boards that look like wood. But they're actually made of a building material that Woodpecker created. It's a mix of powdered coffee husks and recycled plastic. Woodpecker has been creating eco-friendly building materials for around 10 years. Before deciding on coffee, they tried mixing rice, grass and sawdust with the plastic. But coffee was the strongest material they tested.
Besides being strong and eco-friendly, Woodpecker's lumber is easy to transport. This is important because many of the people who need housing live in remote places in Colombia. The lumber is often transported using small boats, helicopters, or even donkeys, so it can't be too heavy.
Woodpecker homes can cost as little as $4,500 dollars, and they usually take less than a week to build. Woodpecker sends workers to build most homes. But they also have kits for customers who want to build the homes themselves. The lumber comes in different colors, so the houses don't even need to be painted!
In the future, Woodpecker wants to add other eco-friendly features to its houses. The company also hopes to make their affordable homes available worldwide.

Build Your House With Coffee!
Environment
Colombia makes lots of coffee. But making coffee is bad for Colombia's environment. Coffee beans grow inside a husk. Workers take the husks off the coffee beans. Then they throw the husks away. These husks make a lot of waste. Colombia also has another problem. Many people don't have homes. One company is solving both problems at once. The company is called Woodpecker. Woodpecker is using the coffee husks to make homes!
First, Woodpecker mixes coffee waste with plastic to make boards. Then they use these boards to make houses. The houses look like regular wooden houses. The boards come in different colors, so people don't need to paint their houses!
Woodpecker houses cost around $4,500 dollars. This is much less than other houses. The houses are strong and easy to build too. Workers can build a house in less than a week. You can also build your own house. Woodpecker sells kits with everything you need to make your own husk home.




Animals in the Zone
Environment
In 1986, there was a terrible accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. After the accident, there was radiation everywhere. It was very dangerous! That's why more than 300,000 people left their homes in the area. Scientists were worried.  Nothing will live near Chernobyl again, they thought.
But the scientists were wrong!
Today, the area near Chernobyl is a nature preserve. Many different animals live there. There are large animals, such as deer, horses, brown bears, boars, and wolves. Foxes and many other small animals live there too. The area has many birds, such as eagles and owls. It also has storks, swans, and other water birds.
How do we know about the animals? Scientists study them. They put special cameras inside the dangerous areas. The cameras take pictures of the animals.
Today, Chernobyl seems safe for animals. But it isn't safe for people. Some scientists say it will be safe in 3,000 years. Others say 20,000 years. That's a long time to wait!
 

Animals in the Zone
Environment
In April, 1986, there was an explosion, then fires at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine. Radiation spread over the area, and as far away as Sweden. It was the world's worst nuclear accident. More than 300,000 people from the area had to leave. Scientists didn't expect anyone or anything to survive in the area around Chernobyl. That's why "exclusion zones" - areas people weren't allowed to enter - were created. They kept people away and safe. But what about wildlife in the area?
Surprisingly, the animals around Chernobyl aren't just surviving � they're thriving! The exclusion zones are now a nature preserve - one of Europe's largest! There are many types of birds, such as eagles, owls, storks, and swans. Beavers, badgers, and foxes live there too. There are also large animals, including deer, brown bears, boars, and wolves. "It's just incredible. You can't go anywhere without seeing wolves," says ecologist James Beasley.
Beasley is one of the scientists studying Chernobyl's wildlife. Because scientists can't stay long inside the exclusion zones, they leave special cameras inside the zones to take pictures of the animals. During a five-week study, Beasley's cameras took pictures of 14 different kinds of animals!
One type of horse, Przewalski's horse, was almost extinct in the world. To save these horses, they were taken to several different places. In the 1990s, about 30 of them were brought to live near Chernobyl. Today, there are more than 150!
Scientists don't know when it will be safe for people to live in the area again. Some say 3,000 years, others say 20,000 years! But hopefully, the animals will continue to thrive.

Animals in the Zone
Environment
In April, 1986, the world's worst nuclear accident happened at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is today northern Ukraine. An explosion, followed by fires at the power plant, spread radiation throughout the region and as far away as Sweden. More than 300,000 people were evacuated, but allowed to take almost nothing with them for fear of contamination. Due to high levels of radiation, scientists predicted the area would become a "dead zone" - a wasteland where nothing could survive. They were wrong!
Amazingly, the wildlife around Chernobyl isn't just surviving - it's thriving! After the disaster, exclusion zones - areas where people aren't allowed - were created around Chernobyl, in Ukraine and Belarus, to keep people safely away from the toxic area. The zones have become one of Europe's largest nature preserves! There are at least ten species of big birds, such as hawks, eagles, owls, storks, and swans. Beavers, otters, badgers, foxes, and minks live there too. Many larger animals can be spotted, including deer, brown bears, lynxes, boars, and wolves. "It's just incredible. You can't go anywhere without seeing wolves," says ecologist James Beasley.
Beasley is one of the scientists doing research on wildlife in the exclusion zones. Because researchers have limited access to the zones, they use special equipment to gather data remotely. Drones and hidden cameras help scientists keep track of the animals. Beasley was surprised by the types of animals cameras caught during one five-week study - fourteen species, including moose, weasels, and hares!
While almost all of the animals around Chernobyl are native to the region, Przewalski's horse, a non-native species, is also thriving there. In an effort to save these horses from extinction, they were taken to several places in the world, including Chernobyl. In the 1990's, when it was considered safe enough for wildlife, around 30 horses were released into the area. Today, the herd has grown to over 150 horses!
Will it ever be safe for people to return to their homes in the Chernobyl region? Scientists estimate humans won't be able to live in the area around the former power plant for at least 3,000 years - maybe as long as 20,000! Meanwhile, hopefully, the animals will continue to thrive.




The City That�s Floating into the Future
Environment
The Maldives is the lowest country on Earth. It's a nation of 1,200 coral islands in the Indian Ocean, and not one island reaches a height of two meters above sea level! So, imagine the alarm caused there by rising sea levels and predictions that the country may be underwater in the near future. Can Maldivians stop the sea?
One bold plan to save the Maldives is to create environmentally-friendly floating islands. The first floating island, called the Maldives Floating City, or MFC, will be built soon. MFC will be inside a ring of coral reefs. It will be attached to the reefs so that it floats on top of the water. This will keep it safe, no matter how the sea level changes.
MFC is planned to cover about two square kilometers. The layout of the buildings on the island will twist and turn, giving the island a look similar to some corals. Tree-lined streets with thousands of brightly-colored low-rise houses will be connected by canals and bridges. Besides walking, people will get around MFC by boat, bike, or electric scooter - no cars allowed! Other important services, such as a hospital and a school, are part of the plans. And the best part? All of the houses will have an ocean view!
MFC has plans for tourism too. Today, the Maldives is a tourist's paradise, and thousands of visitors come for the amazing weather, white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and marine life. Because the Maldives' economy relies on tourism, there will be vacation homes on MFC, as well as hotels, restaurants, and shops. Conveniently, MFC will be close to the airport - only ten minutes away by boat.
Another major appeal of MFC is sustainability. The city will be powered by solar energy and store its own drinking water. Because cars won't be allowed, the air in this eco-friendly city will stay pollution-free. And not only won't MFC damage precious, existing coral reefs, but new reefs will be grown as well.
The Maldives government hopes that MFC will inspire other countries trying to survive climate change. "In the Maldives, we cannot stop the waves, but we can rise with them," says Mohamed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives.
 

The City That�s Floating into the Future
Environment
The Maldives is the lowest country on Earth. It's a nation of 1,200 islands in the Indian Ocean, and the highest island is less than two meters above sea level. Because of climate change, the sea level is rising. The Maldives is in danger of being under the water in the near future!
There is an exciting new plan to save the Maldives by building floating islands. The country is going to begin building their first floating island, called the Maldives Floating City (MFC), soon. It will be about two square kilometers in size and there will be coral reefs around it. They will attach MFC to the reefs, so that it floats on the water. That way, MFC will be safe when the sea rises.
There will be streets with thousands of houses on MFC, and it will have bridges and canals to connect the streets. Besides walking, people will get around MFC by boat, bike, or electric scooter - no cars allowed on this eco-friendly island! The plans also include a hospital and a school. And the best part? All of the houses will have an ocean view!
MFC has plans for tourism, too. The Maldives needs tourists, so MFC will have hotels, restaurants, shops, and everything visitors could want. And it will be easy to get there, because the Maldives' airport is only 10 minutes away by boat.
Hopefully, other island countries will learn from the Maldives and build floating islands too.  According to Mohamed Nasheed, who was President of the Maldives, "In the Maldives, we cannot stop the waves, but we can rise with them."

The Maldives, in the Indian Ocean, is the lowest country on Earth. It has 1,200 very low coral islands. They are less than two meters above sea level! Because of climate change, the sea level is rising. Will the Maldives be under the sea in the near future?
There is a plan to save the Maldives. The country is going to build islands that float. The first island is called the Maldives Floating City, or MFC. MFC will be about two square kilometers. It will have thousands of houses and other buildings. There will be shops, restaurants, a hospital, and a school. For tourists, there will be hotels. And MFC will be close to the Maldives' airport - only ten minutes by boat.
MFC will be eco-friendly. People will walk around the city or ride bikes and electric scooters - no cars allowed! There will also be bridges and canals to go from street to street.
People in the Maldives hope floating islands will save their country.




Quiet the Seas, Please!
Environment
It's very noisy under the sea. Marine animals make noise. Wind, rain, and waves make noise too. These ocean sounds come from nature. But some ocean sounds come from people. People build by the sea. They drill for oil. They take things from place to place in large ships. They do loud sports, like water skiing. All of these activities make noise pollution.
Underwater noise pollution is a big problem for marine animals. Because of noise pollution, they can't hear the ocean's natural sounds. Sea animals use natural sounds to find food, and stay safe. Sounds give them other important information too. For example, some fish use sounds to find their way home. Blue whales call to each other from kilometers away. Sounds help marine animals survive.
There are some easy ways to fix underwater noise pollution. Slow ships make less noise than fast ships. Special "curtains" stop noises that come from building by the sea. Let's get started. It's time to stop noise pollution in the sea!

Quiet the Seas, Please!
Environment
Do you enjoy the ocean? It may seem like the world under the ocean is peaceful and silent. In fact, it's very busy and noisy.
Sound is very important for animals living in the water. They use sound to communicate, find food, and stay safe. For example, a female blue whale can hear a male's sounds from thousands of kilometers away. Baby clown fish float in the ocean until they hear noises from reefs that are far away. The noises guide them "home" to the reef. So, what happens to marine animals when they can't hear these sounds?
The ocean has natural sounds from waves, wind, and rain. Sea animals also make noise. The problem is human noise, caused by shipping, building, and drilling for oil. Water sports and other activities add to the noise. All this human noise pollution is a dangerous threat to sea life. "We've silenced the soundtrack of the healthy ocean and replaced it with the sound that we create," says marine scientist Dr. Carlos Duarte.
Some problems, like higher water temperatures and plastic pollution, are difficult to solve. According to Duarte, however, fixing noise pollution is easy: just turn off the noise! How do we know it will work? In April 2020, 60% of the world's population was in some kind of lockdown due to COVID-19. During that time, research showed that ocean noise went down by 20%.
Meanwhile, solutions to the noise problem already exist. Special "curtains" can stop noise from building by the sea. Special propellers can make ships quieter. Just making ships travel more slowly would help too. The question is: what are we waiting for?

Quiet the Seas, Please!
Environment
You're floating on your back in the ocean, the sun warming your face, while a gentle breeze passes over you. You hear the far-off sound of small waves reaching the shore, and a seagull calls out as it flies by. All is peaceful. The ocean seems like a giant, almost-silent paradise. Under the surface, however, it's a busy, noisy world of life and sound.

In the ocean, sound is as important as light is to those of us who live above water. Marine animals use sound to communicate, navigate, locate food, avoid predators, and find mates. For many underwater animals, sound is life. A female blue whale can hear mating calls from a male thousands of kilometers away. Baby clown fish, floating in the open ocean, use distant reef noises to find their way "home" to the reef where they will spend their lives. The question is, what happens to marine animals when they can't hear these extremely important sounds?
Natural ocean sounds come from wind, waves, rain, and even underwater earthquakes. Creatures that live in the sea add to the noisy environment. However, in the last century, human activity has brought terrible noise pollution to the oceans. Construction along the coast, shipping, commercial fishing, drilling for oil, and recreational activities - to name just a few human activities - are a deadly threat to our oceans. "We've silenced the soundtrack of the healthy ocean and replaced it with the sound that we create," says marine scientist Dr. Carlos Duarte.
When stress caused by noise pollution is added to other threats, sea life doesn't stand a chance. Some problems - like rising water temperatures and pollutants entering the ocean - are difficult problems to solve. Reducing noise pollution, however, is a different story. "The moment we switch our noise off," Duarte says, "the impact disappears." How do we know? In April 2020, when 60% of the world's population was in some form of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, research that showed ocean noise went down by 20%.
Many solutions to the problem already exist, such as noise-reducing propellers and "bubble curtains" that prevent construction noise. Simply reducing the speed that ships travel would have a big effect too. So, if solutions exist, what are we waiting for?




Do Birds Sing in the City?
Environment
Birds don't just inspire humans and stimulate our imaginations - they help make cities more harmonious. Birds eat insects, pollinate plants, and thrill us with their songs. They are part of the city's natural environment, which experts say gives people the benefits of reducing stress, improving health, and increasing feelings of well-being. Unfortunately, however, cities are full of dangers for birds.
"There are many things we can and must do to make our cities more bird-friendly," says Timothy Beatley. A professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture, Beatley wrote a book called The Bird-Friendly City. In it, he discusses creative solutions, showing the changes cities need to make in order to have happy, healthy birds. Where to start? Tall buildings.
Until recently, most medium-to-tall buildings in cities weren't designed for bird safety. Glass windows and mirror-like surfaces are hazards for birds because they reflect trees and sky. Birds mistake them for their natural environment, and they fly right into them! These collisions kill hundreds of millions of birds each year. And birds migrating through a city at night are drawn to buildings' lights, causing more fatal collisions. But buildings can be designed to be safer for birds. For example, the less glass used to construct the outside of a building, the better. And instead of being smooth, all glass should have a pattern which helps birds recognize the danger and avoid it. To keep birds away from buildings at night, automatic controls can turn off the interior lights.
In addition to keeping birds safe, some cities - such as New York and London - are trying to attract different types of birds. They've created areas of trees and plants across the city to form a "green corridor." Birds and other wildlife are enticed by the greenery where they can rest, feed, and breed. Scientists say that having a range of animal species in an area strengthens the ecosystem, helping birds survive. Recently, thanks to London's green corridor, some rare species have returned to the center of the crowded city.
"Birds have brought a lot of joy and meaning to my life," says Beatley. But more than that, helping city birds thrive is as important for our future as it is for theirs.

Do Birds Sing in the City?
Environment
Even in noisy, crowded cities, people enjoy the beautiful songs of birds. Birds are part of a city's natural environment, eating insects and pollinating plants. Experts say having nature in cities improves people's general health and happiness. That's why birds are good for people in cities. However, cities can be dangerous for birds.
Tall buildings are one of the biggest dangers to birds in cities. Tall buildings have many windows and other smooth glass surfaces. Glass reflects sky and trees which birds think are real, so they don't try to keep away from the glass. They fly right into it! Also, the many lights inside these tall buildings attract birds when they fly through a city at night. Every year, hundreds of millions of birds die by crashing into buildings.
According to Timothy Beatley, a professor who wrote a book called The Bird-Friendly City, we need to design buildings that keep birds safe. Buildings with less glass are safer for birds. Glass surfaces with a pattern are safer too, because patterns help birds recognize the danger, and stay away. To protect birds at night, a building's lights can be programmed to turn off automatically.
Some cities, such as New York and London, want to attract more and different types of birds. They have created small areas of trees and plants across the city. Birds and other animals come to rest, eat, and breed in these lovely green spots. Scientists say having different kinds of animals together in an area is good for the city's ecosystem - including the birds!
What are cities in your country doing to keep your birds safe?

Do Birds Sing in the City?
Environment
People in cities need nature. Nature makes us healthy and happy. That's why birds are important. They are part of nature. They fly in the sky. They sing beautiful songs. And we feel happy.
In some cities, there are special places for birds. London and New York have areas with plants and trees for their birds. Different kinds of birds come to live in these green areas. Other animals come to these green areas, too. That's good for the animals, the birds, and the people.
Unfortunately, cities are also dangerous for birds. Hundreds of millions of birds die in cities every year. One reason is the tall buildings. They have a lot of windows and other glass. Birds don't see the glass. They fly into the glass... and die.
Luckily, we can make buildings safer for birds. Windows with special glass can save many birds. We can also turn off lights in buildings at night. Why? Because birds fly to the lights and crash into the buildings.
Let's all try to save our birds!





Many animals in the world are endangered. Scientists try to help endangered animals. Sometimes they use dogs to help. Why? Because dogs have an excellent sense of smell. Dogs can smell things that people can't. Dogs help scientists find endangered animals. Then, the scientists can study the animals and help them. We call these dogs "conservation dogs."
Guam is an island with many birds. Many years ago, the first brown tree snakes arrived in Guam. The snakes ate lots of birds. Today, people want to save the birds. Conservation dogs are helping. When boats and planes arrive on Guam, conservation dogs smell them. They can smell snakes inside the boats and cars. Then people catch the snakes.
When there were big fires in Australia, many koalas died. People wanted to help the survivors. But koalas like to hide. They are very hard to see. Conservation dogs helped find the koalas. They saved the koalas!
Conservation dogs have "super" noses. That's good news for endangered animals around the world.

A Dog's Nose Knows
Environment
A dog's sense of smell is thousands of times stronger than a human's, so it's not surprising that dogs are used to find everything - from lost hikers to contraband in airports. People also train dogs to use their noses to protect wildlife. "Conservation dogs" help scientists and conservation workers find, study, and protect endangered animals.
Wild animals can hide really well, and people can't always find them. That's when conservation dogs' powerful sense of smell is useful. These dogs notice small traces animals leave when they pass through nature. For example, conservation dogs find scat that people might miss. Scientists study scat to learn important information about an animal's health and exactly where it lives. This information helps scientists plan the best way to help an endangered species.
Conservation dogs also used their noses to find koalas after recent fires in Australia. Many koalas died, and people tried to save the survivors. Since koalas are so hard to find, the dogs were more successful than humans at finding them.
Another important job for conservation dogs is helping find invasive species. These types of plants and animals move into natural areas and push out the animals that live there. Dogs find invasive species early enough so humans can try to keep them out. In Guam, brown tree snakes are killing a lot of birds that live there. Now, conservation dogs check for the snakes in every boat and plane entering or leaving the island. Because conservation dogs' amazing noses can even find invasive species in water, they protect fish too.
There are thousands of endangered animals in the world today. Which species will these "super noses" help next?

A Dog's Nose Knows
Environment
Dogs' noses have amazing abilities of detection. While humans rely heavily on their eyesight to learn about their surroundings, dogs use their sense of smell - thousands of times stronger than ours! There are many stories about dogs' incredible noses - finding everything from lost hikers to airport contraband. But did you know that humans are training these super noses to protect wildlife and wild places across the globe? "Conservation dogs" help conservation professionals and researchers find, study, and protect endangered animals.
Conservation dogs use their powerful sense of smell to locate animals living in places that are hard for us to see. They also pick up on traces of animals. For example, these highly-trained dogs can track the scent of an animal that has recently passed by, and they nose out scat - the droppings animals leave behind - that people might miss. Studying scat gives scientists critical information about exactly where an animal lives, as well as its overall health. They use this information to figure out the best way to help an endangered species, including designing protocols to protect animals from eager tourists.
Conservation dogs are particularly successful at locating invasive species. When invasive plants or animals move into natural areas, they often compete with native species for limited resources, which can put native wildlife at risk. Dogs find invasive species early enough for wildlife professionals to take action. In Guam, where brown tree snakes have destroyed at least ten native bird species, dogs check boats and planes at points of exit, keeping the dangerous "hitchhikers" from reaching other islands. Conservation dogs can even find invasive species in water. In western USA, a native fish species, the cutthroat trout, is being pushed out by the invasive brook trout. Conservation professionals let the dogs smell buckets of water taken from different rivers. The dogs correctly identify which buckets have brook trout traces.
Conservation dogs' amazing noses also help scientists monitor many endangered species, such as the rare Cross River gorilla in Cameroon. And after the recent bushfires in Australia, conservation dogs worked to locate koalas that survived. Because koalas are very hard to find, the dogs were more successful than human rescuers.
Meanwhile, there are still thousands of endangered animal species. What might these sniffing superstars aim their noses at next?





Did you ever think shoes could be bad for the environment? Of the billions of pairs of shoes made each year, millions are thrown away, ending up in landfills. Because most shoes are made with plastic and rubber instead of sustainable materials, they are almost impossible to recycle. Now, a New Zealand company called YY Nation is making eco-friendly shoes using natural, and unusual, materials.
Jeremy Bank is YY Nation's founder. YY (pronounced waewae) means "foot" in Maori, the indigenous language of New Zealand. Bank knew about footwear from working in his family's chain of shoe stores, Banks Shoes. In 2018, Bank was playing with his daughter on a beach in Maui, Hawaii, USA. He saw tiny bits of plastic mixed in with the sand, and a shoe washed up on the shore. It got him thinking about preserving the environment for his children. "I realized the shoe industry creates a lot of waste," says Bank. So, he began his two-and-a-half-year journey to developing a sustainable shoe.
YY Nation currently offers four different styles of shoes. They include two types of regular sneakers with laces, and one high-top style. The fourth style is a slip-on loafer, which is a shoe with no shoelaces. One of the company's challenges was to create a durable sole without using chemicals. In the end, they made two types of soles. Customers can choose recycled rubber soles mixed with sugar cane, or mixed with locally-sourced algae.
Other natural materials are used, too. There are "leather" parts made from pineapple leaves from the Philippines (which are normally burned as waste), and shoelaces made of recycled ocean plastic. Depending on the style, the top part of the shoes is made from either New Zealand wool, or bamboo woven with nylon thread from recycled plastic. Plant-based glue holds the shoe together. Even the box is environmentally friendly. It's made with recycled materials.
Bank plans to continue finding new and better ways to use materials that already exist. "This is the least sustainable shoe we will ever make," says Bank.

Did you ever think that shoes can be bad for the environment? Millions of pairs of shoes end up in landfills each year. And most are made with plastic and other materials that aren't biodegradable. Now, a New Zealand company called YY Nation is making sustainable shoes using natural, and unusual, materials.
The founder of YY Nation is Jeremy Bank. In 2018, Bank was playing with his daughter on a beach in Hawaii, USA. He saw plastic mixed in with the sand, and an old shoe. This experience made Bank start thinking about how to protect the environment. "I realized the shoe industry creates a lot of waste," says Bank. So, he began his two-and-a-half-year journey to making a sustainable shoe.
YY Nation shoes come in four different styles. They include three types of sneakers with shoelaces. One pair of high-tops and two pairs of low-tops. The fourth style is a loafer, which has no shoelaces.
One of YY Nation's challenges was to create a strong sole for the bottom part of the shoes. But they didn't want to use any chemicals. They decided to use recycled rubber mixed with either sugar cane or algae. The top part of the shoes is made from either New Zealand wool, or bamboo with recycled plastic. Another material YY Nation uses is "leather" made from pineapple leaves. And the shoelaces are made of recycled ocean plastic. Plant-based glue holds the shoe together. Even the shoebox can be recycled!
YY Nation plans to continue finding new ways to use materials that already exist. "This is the least sustainable shoe we will ever make," says Bank.

Shoe companies make billions of pairs of shoes each year. But most companies use materials you can't recycle. So, people throw away millions of old shoes. This is bad for the environment. But now there's a new eco-friendly shoe company. The company is in New Zealand. It's called YY Nation.
YY Nation uses recycled rubber to make the soles. They also use sugar cane or algae. The company makes four different styles of shoes. Three styles are sneakers with shoelaces. The fourth style is a loafer.
To make the top part of the shoe, YY Nation often uses soft wool. The wool is from sheep in New Zealand. Sometimes they mix bamboo and recycled plastic. YY Nation even uses pineapple leaves! The leaves look like leather. They use these "leather" pieces to decorate the top of the shoes. YY Nation also uses special glue. The glue comes from plants. They use recycled ocean plastic to make the shoelaces. Even the shoebox is recycled!
YY Nation plans to make many more shoes with natural materials.




Seaweed for Life!
Environment
What do you know about seaweed? Seaweed is a plant that grows in saltwater. There are more than 11,000 kinds of seaweed. Some look like grass. Others look like lettuce. Seaweed can be red, brown, or green. Seaweed grows in different shapes and sizes. Giant Kelp is a kind of seaweed - it's one of the biggest plants on Earth!
Seaweed has many benefits. Seaweed has a lot of vitamins and minerals. Fertilizer with seaweed keeps your garden healthy. Food companies use seaweed in many products. Seaweed makes yoghurt, ice cream, and other foods creamy. It's also in products you can't eat. For example, seaweed is in shaving cream, and lipstick.
Scientists say seaweed is important. It's good for the planet. It helps keep the air clean. And it's good for the environment, too.
Bren Smith helps people open seaweed farms. Seaweed farms keep sea animals and beaches safe. Seaweed farms also give people jobs. Smith believes growing seaweed is the best way to help the environment. The more seaweed, the better!

Seaweed for Life!
Environment
Did you know that Giant Kelp is one of the largest plants on Earth? But this plant doesn't grow on land. Giant Kelp is one of more than 11,000 types of seaweed. Seaweed is algae, a water plant without roots. Seaweed can be red, brown, or green - and comes in many different sizes. Some types of seaweed look just like grass. Other types look like lettuce!
There are many benefits to having seaweed in our lives. Seaweed has a lot of vitamins and minerals to keep us healthy. Some fertilizers have dried seaweed mixed in with it. The dried seaweed helps keep your garden healthy, too. Seaweed is also used in food. Many companies use seaweed to make their yoghurt, ice cream, and salad dressing thicker. It's in non-food items as well. Toothpaste, shaving cream, and even lipstick can all contain seaweed! Seaweed is a worldwide, billion-dollar industry.
Seaweed is an important part of the Earth's ecosystem. Some sea animals live in seaweed; others eat it. And like all plants, seaweed creates oxygen, and takes in carbon dioxide. This keeps the air clean, and fights global climate change. 
Many people are excited about using seaweed to help prevent climate change. Bren Smith started GreenWave in 2013. GreenWave is an organization that helps people start seaweed farms. Seaweed farms help rebuild damaged ocean ecosystems. How? Seaweed takes in and "cleans up" chemicals which harm the ocean. And seaweed farms create much-needed jobs. Smith believes that seaweed farming will help the environment.
People around the world continue to search for new ways that seaweed can make our lives better. What will they think of next?

Seaweed for Life!
Environment
What comes to mind when you hear the word "seaweed"? Maybe you remember the last time you ate sushi - rice, fish, and vegetables rolled in a sheet of dried seaweed. Perhaps you saw some seaweed washed up on the sand the last time you went to the beach. But what is seaweed? Seaweed is algae - a water plant without roots. Seaweed lives in saltwater, and comes in a range of colors - red, brown, and green. Some seaweed looks like long, flowing grass, and other types have wide, curling leaves. And it ranges in size - from tiny phytoplankton to Giant Kelp - one of the largest plants on Earth! There are more than 11,000 species of this plant!
There are many benefits to having seaweed in our lives. Seaweed is high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. It is used to thicken foods, such as yoghurt, ice cream, and salad dressing. Seaweed is even used in some medications, and in toothpaste, and shaving cream. You'll also find seaweed in lipstick, and other cosmetics.
Seaweed can help your garden grow better too; fertilizer with dried, ground-up seaweed adds important nutrients to soil, such as potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The commercial seaweed market is a worldwide, multi-billion-dollar industry.
Some marine animals live in seaweed; others eat it. Seaweed is also essential to the ecosystem of our planet. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says seaweed makes anywhere from 50% to 80% of the Earth's oxygen. Additionally, seaweed absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Many people are excited about using seaweed to help fight global warming. Seaweed farming projects have begun popping up across the globe. For example, the non-profit organization, GreenWave was founded in 2013 to help people start seaweed farms. In addition to providing job opportunities, the seaweed farms help rebuild marine ecosystems. How? Seaweed absorbs and "cleans up" chemicals which pollute the ocean. GreenWave's founder Bren Smith believes strongly in the power of seaweed farming, "We can either run and hide..., or we can turn around and embrace the sea as a climate change solution," he says.
People around the world continue to search for new ways that seaweed can make our lives better. What will they think of next?





According to the World Health Organization, nine out of ten people worldwide breathe polluted air. Living in cities with dangerously high levels of air pollution can cause health problems, such as heart and lung disease. One way to reduce pollution and make the air safer to breathe is by planting trees. But sometimes, there isn't enough space to plant trees. So, artists are creating giant murals on buildings, using a special kind of paint, called Airlite. Airlite uses energy from sunlight to trap pollutants and change them into harmless substances. The murals actually become air-purifying surfaces!
Italian street artist Federico Massa created a mural at one of the most polluted intersections in Rome. For 21 days, Massa worked on the 1,000-square-meter mural called "Hunting Pollution." It shows a giant heron - an endangered species - hunting in a polluted sea. Massa wants his heron to call attention to environmental issues. The mural, which Massa painted with Airlite, can purify the same amount of air as 30 trees.
As part of their "City Forest" project, the US shoe company Converse is sponsoring a series of eco-friendly murals. The first one was created by artists Teerayut Puechpen and Sorravis Prakong. The pair made an eco-friendly mural in Bangkok, Thailand. The mural's main image is of two hands, which symbolize unity. "I admire that Thai people always help each other when we face critical situations," says Prakong. The mural, painted on the side of a building in the city center, can clean as much air as 150 trees.
The City Forest slogan "Create Together For Tomorrow" appears on a mural near the bustling Politechnika train station in Warsaw, Poland. It has the same environmental effect as planting 780 trees. Graphic designer Dawid Ryski and painter Maciek Polak worked together on the mural, which shows smiling, intertwined flowers surrounded by buildings. Ryski says it shows "... the city and nature complementing each other perfectly."
Converse is planning murals for additional cities, including Lima, Belgrade and Jakarta. Hopefully, artists across the globe will continue to create beautiful artwork to improve air quality for us all.

Art That Cleans the Air

Cities around the world have air pollution. Air pollution is dangerous; it can cause heart and lung disease. One solution is planting trees. Trees help clean the air, making it safer to breathe. In cities, however, there isn't always enough space for trees. So, there's another solution - a special kind of paint, called Airlite. Airlite uses energy from sunlight to clean the air. Artists paint murals with Airlite paint. The murals clean the air, like trees.
Street artist Federico Massa painted a 1,000-square-meter mural in Rome, Italy. Massa completed it in 21 days. In the mural is a water bird called a heron, which is an endangered species. The mural, made with Airlite, can clean the same amount of air as 30 trees.
Recently, the US shoe company Converse started a project called "City Forest." This project helps artists paint eco-friendly murals around the world. Thai artists Teerayut Puechpen and Sorravis Prakong made the project's first mural. They painted the mural on the side of a building, in the center of Bangkok, Thailand. The mural shows two hands, which symbolize unity. It can clean as much air as 150 trees.
Another City Forest mural is in Warsaw, Poland. It is near a busy train station. Graphic designer Dawid Ryski and painter Maciek Polak worked together on the mural. It shows smiling flowers surrounded by skyscrapers. The mural can clean as much air as 780 trees.
Converse is planning more murals for more cities, including Lima, Belgrade and Jakarta. Hopefully, artists will continue to create beautiful artwork to clean our air.

Is It Messy or Is It Cluttercore?
Lifestyle
Some houses have clutter. "Clutter" is when there are too many things in one space. Many people think clutter is bad. They say clutter makes a house look messy. But lots of people like to collect things. They put their collections all over the house. They don't think this is "clutter." They think it's "cluttercore."
Cluttercore is a new way to decorate your house. With cluttercore, you decorate your house with objects you collect. But you organize them, so they don't look messy. For example, you may have a collection of dolls, and a collection of clocks. You put your dolls on a table in the living room. You put your clocks on a wall in the dining room.
Daniel Mathis loves cluttercore. Cluttercore fills Mathis's apartment. His collection of old wooden rulers is on the bedroom floor. His collection of black candles is on a table. Mathis also collects seashells and pottery. Mathis shares pictures of his collections on the Internet. Many people call Mathis the "King of Cluttercore!"

Is It Messy or Is It Cluttercore?
Lifestyle
Many children collect things, like rocks, stickers, or small dolls. But when they become adults, they're expected to "tidy up" and throw their collections away. This is because most home designers focus on neat, clean homes, and encourage people to "declutter." Yet many adults enjoy collecting. They want to keep their old collections or collect new things. Well, they're in luck! There is a new design trend called "cluttercore."
With cluttercore, people collect things, but display them in a neat and organized way. If they collect different types of objects, they group similar items together, and display each group in a different place. For example, they may take their collection of pictures and cover an entire wall with them. Then they may take their collection of clocks and display them on a table.
Daniel Mathis is a huge fan of cluttercore. Mathis lives in a large 111.5 square-meter apartment in Oklahoma, USA. He has tables covered with knickknacks; one holds a group of black candles. His collection of  antique wooden rulers sits on the bedroom floor. Paintings hang on a green wall in the dining room. And his seashell collection sits among many other collections in his home office. He also has more than 400 pieces of pottery, which are displayed around the house.
Mathis and other cluttercore fans share their collections on the Internet. Cluttercore became extremely popular on social media during the pandemic. People were stuck at home, feeling worried. Surrounding themselves with "stuff" made them feel better. Cluttercore lets people celebrate their clutter. "Why fight it?" says Mathis. "It's what I love to do."

Is It Messy or Is It Cluttercore?
Lifestyle
Children often collect things, such as rocks, dolls, or stickers. Research shows that being surrounded by their objects makes children happy and secure. But when children become adults, they're expected to be more organized, and make sure their homes don't have too much clutter. "Clutter is stuff that is no longer useful but gets in the way of living," says Jennifer Howard, who wrote a book called Clutter: An Untidy History. Most modern design trends encourage people to tidy up rooms, and "declutter" their homes. Yet, many adults enjoy collecting. They might want to keep their old collections, or create new ones. Lucky for them, there's a new design trend called "cluttercore."
With cluttercore, people keep and celebrate their collections, instead of throwing them away. In crowded cluttercore rooms, many things are on display, but they're organized. The idea is to group similar items together, and give each group its own area, so rooms don't feel messy. For example, you may display a collection of photographs by covering a wall with them, from top to bottom. In the same room, take a different group of objects, such as clocks or small statues, and display them on a table.
Collector Daniel Mathis is sometimes called the "King of Cluttercore.'' His different collections are arranged around his large 111.5 square meter apartment in Oklahoma, USA. Two tables are completely covered with objects made of brass. Another has a bunch of tall black candles. Paintings of faces hang on a green wall in the dining room. Mathis keeps a framed seashell collection in his home office, as well as part of his pottery collection - he has more than 400 pieces of pottery around the house! "Collecting is in my blood... and so why fight it?" says Mathis. "It's what I love to do."
Like other cluttercore fans, Mathis shares his cluttercore pictures on the Internet. Cluttercore began trending on social media during the pandemic. For many people stuck at home, cluttercore was just what the doctor ordered. "We want[ed] to feel safe, we want[ed] to feel comfortable, we want[ed] to feel protected and taken care of - stuff can act like a literal cocoon," says Howard. Can cluttercore change our views on clutter?





For many of us, living on a budget can be challenging. However, the Internet has tons of tips on how we can manage our money. In fact, one budgeting method is blowing up on social media. It's a surprisingly low-tech method, called "cash stuffing." Cash stuffing is just a new name for an old system called "envelope budgeting." It involves using envelopes to help you save money.
To start, you'll need envelopes - one for each type of expense you have, such as food, clothing, utilities, and travel. Write the name of each category on a different envelope. Next, figure out how much you spend each month in each category. Then, when you get paid, leave enough money in the bank for fixed expenses - such as car payments or rent - and take the rest in cash. Finally, divide up the cash between the different envelopes. "Stuff" the correct amount of money you need into each one. If you have any cash left over, put it in an envelope labeled "savings" to keep for a rainy day. Or have a special envelope for something you want to save up for or treat yourself to.
Cash stuffing helps you save money by making you aware of your spending, and not letting you spend money you don't have. If you put $100 dollars in your "clothes" envelope, then when you go shopping, you're limited to spending that amount. If you want to spend more, you can take money from another envelope, if it's available. If not, $100 it is! So, you'll never go over budget like you can with credit cards, which allow you to spend money you don't have, and can cause you to get into debt.
Although cash stuffing is low-tech and old-school, it has become extremely popular among millennials.
It's so popular, that millions of viewers watch videos on social media of people just stuffing envelopes with cash. Of course, they cash stuff in style, with long, manicured nails and using colorful plastic envelopes. In fact, many companies are now selling cool cash stuffing supplies. But don't buy any, unless you have money set aside for it in a "cash stuffing" envelope!
 

Don't Spend it. Stuff it!
Lifestyle
Have you seen the popular "cash stuffing" videos on social media? People open envelopes and fill them with cash. Cash stuffing is a way of budgeting your money, so you don't spend more money than you have.
To start, you need envelopes - one for each type of expense you have, such as food, clothing, utilities, and travel. Write the name of each category on a different envelope. Next, figure out how much you spend each month in each category. Then, when you get paid, take the money in cash. Finally, divide up the cash between the different envelopes. "Stuff" the correct amount of money you need into each one. If you have any cash left over, put it in an envelope labeled "savings." Or create an envelope for something special that you want, like new shoes.
Then, when you go shopping - for shoes, for example - bring your "shoes" envelope. If the envelope has $40 in it, you have $40 to spend. You can't spend more. This is better than using a credit card. Credit cards let you to spend money you don't have, which can get you into debt.
Cash stuffing isn't actually new. It's an old budgeting method that used to be called "envelope budgeting." But even though cash stuffing is old-school, and also low-tech, it is very popular with millennials. Many people make videos of themselves stuffing cash in their envelopes. And millions of viewers watch them! Some "cash stuffers" use fancy, decorated envelopes. And many companies are selling these cool cash stuffing supplies. But don't buy them - unless you have an envelope labelled "cash stuffing supplies!"

Don't Spend it. Stuff it!
Lifestyle
It's hard to save money. But "cash stuffing" can help. Cash stuffing is a way to budget your money.
To start, think of expenses you have each month, like food and the phone bill. Then, get envelopes. Write each expense on a different envelope. Next, think of something you want to buy, such as clothes. Make an envelope for that too. Also, make a "savings" envelope.
When you get a paycheck, take the money in cash. Then "pay" your envelopes. For example, is your phone bill $35? Then put $35 in your "phone bill" envelope. Do you have any cash left after you stuffed your envelopes? Put that extra money into the "savings" envelope.
The next time you go clothes shopping, take the "clothes" envelope with you. Use only the cash in the envelope. Don't use credit cards. Credit cards let you spend more money than you have.
Many young people make videos of themselves doing cash stuffing. Millions of people watch them. But don't watch cash stuffing. Do it!





Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep each night to stay healthy. But many people don't sleep well. What can they do? Take a sleep vacation! When you take a sleep vacation, you travel to special hotels. These hotels help you sleep better.

One example is the Zedwell in London, England. It has very comfortable beds. And their rooms are soundproof, so no noise gets it. The Zedwell's rooms don't have televisions. They also don't have windows. So, there is nothing else to do!
Another sleep vacation hotel is the H�stens Sleep Spa Hotel in Coimbra, Portugal. Guests choose pillows from a menu. They may choose a soft pillow or a hard pillow.
The Mandarin Oriental hotel is in Geneva, Switzerland. This hotel helps you learn how to sleep better. Guests at the Mandarin Oriental work with Swiss sleep experts for three days. The experts make a sleep plan for each guest. The plan helps guests learn what to do to fall asleep and stay asleep.
Sleep vacations can be a dream come true!

Take a Sleep Vacation!
Lifestyle
Sleep is very important. Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep a night to stay healthy. But many people have difficulty falling - and staying - asleep. This has led to a trend called "sleep tourism." Sleep tourism means traveling somewhere to get a good night's sleep!
Sleep tourists stay in hotels that help encourage good sleep. An example is the Zedwell hotel in London. All rooms are soundproof, so it's completely quiet. And, according to the Zedwell, they have "the most comfortable mattresses in the world." To keep guests from getting distracted, the rooms have no televisions, and they don't even have windows.
Another hotel for sleep tourists is the H�stens Sleep Spa Hotel in Coimbra, Portugal. Sleep spa guests get a "pillow menu," which allows them to choose their pillow based on how hard or soft they want it to be.
The Park Hyatt New York is a sleep tourist hotel in the US. It has an 84-square-meter "sleep suite," which has amenities to help guests sleep. For example, they have very soft sheets, a special sleep mask, and scented oil.
For guests who want to improve their sleep long-term, there's the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. Over three days, guests work with sleep experts. The experts check the guests' sleep quality. Each guest gets a personalized sleep plan to help them develop healthy sleep habits.
Dr. Rebecca Robbins is a sleep researcher. She believes in learning good sleep habits. "Sleep is food for our brain and our body," she says.

Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep each night for their physical and mental health. But for people with sleep disorders, this is only a dream! Sleep disorders affect people around the world, including 70 million people in the US alone. This has led to a trend called "sleep tourism" - traveling to get a good night's sleep!
Most people go on vacation to have fun and escape everyday life. But sleep tourists travel to special hotels to sleep. While all hotels are meant for sleeping, sleep-tourism hotels cater to people with sleep disorders. These hotels follow the rules of good sleep hygiene, which includes a bedroom that is comfortable, quiet and relaxing, and has no television, digital devices, or other distractions.
One sleep-tourism hotel is the Zedwell, in London, England. It promises "the most comfortable mattresses in the world." The Zedwell is the city's first hotel where all the rooms are designed to encourage sleep. Just like a regular hotel, the rooms have a bed and bathroom. But there isn't a television to distract guests or keep them awake. To keep things quiet, the rooms are also windowless and soundproof. In fact, the Zedwell calls their rooms "cocoons."
Another sleep tourism hotel is the H�stens Sleep Spa Hotel in Coimbra, Portugal. One of their amenities is a pillow menu. Guests select pillows made of natural materials based on how hard or soft they are.
In the US, sleep tourists can visit the Park Hyatt New York. The hotel has a special 84-square-meter "sleep suite" and provides many amenities for peaceful sleep, including soft bed linens, a special sleep mask, and scented oil.
Sleep researcher Dr. Rebecca Robbins thinks sleep-tourism hotels should also help guests long-term. The Mandarin Oriental hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, does just that. Guests of the hotel can consult with CENAS, a Swiss sleep medicine center. During a three-day stay, guests have their sleep quality evaluated. Then, they are given a plan for improving their sleep, which might include a change in diet or starting meditation.
Whether you're on a "sleep vacation'' or at home, Dr. Robbins says it's important to relax close to bedtime. "Sleep is food for our brain and our body," she says.





Around ten years ago, Rob Greenfield, an environmental activist popular on social media, decided to stop wearing shoes - even on the streets of New York! And he's not the only one. Over the past decade, walking or running without shoes has become popular as more people embrace a "barefoot lifestyle."
Going barefoot may seem like a new trend, but humans only started wearing shoes about 40,000 years ago. Before then, they moved barefoot over all types of terrain. Walking barefoot builds up tough, thick layers of skin on the sole of the foot. These tough areas of skin, called calluses, protect the feet from extreme temperatures, rocks, and other sharp objects. When humans first started wearing shoes, they wore just thin-soled sandals.
"Barefooters" reject wearing shoes for different reasons. Australian podiatrist Paul Thompson started going barefoot to relieve aches and pains. The soles of our feet have nerve endings that give the brain information about where and how we're moving. Thompson believes shoes cut off this information, make the body move unnaturally, and cause pain or injury. Thompson also says that going barefoot uses certain muscles that strengthen the body.
 
Each summer, Christiane Viehweger searches for edible plants in the forest near her home in Germany - barefoot. Viehweger believes that wearing shoes makes it harder to connect with nature. There are even hiking paths designed just for bare feet. At Godolphin House in Cornwall, England, visitors can let their feet explore smooth wood surfaces, grass and sand, on a "barefoot trail."
Still, not everyone agrees that a barefoot life is the healthiest one. Some podiatrists warn that walking barefoot (especially outside) exposes us to harmful bacteria, fungus, and possible illness. Others say that walking barefoot for an extended amount of time can put too much strain on our feet.
It does, however, seem that humans could benefit from going barefoot some of the time. A good compromise may be wearing minimalist shoes like our ancestors did, which protect the foot while allowing it to move naturally. For those who want to attempt the barefoot lifestyle, Greenfield suggests starting slowly, gradually increasing the amount of time you spend barefoot. Eventually, he believes, you'll be living a more relaxed, stress-free, barefoot life.

Rob Greenfield hasn't worn shoes in almost ten years! Greenfield, an environmental activist who is popular on social media, goes barefoot wherever he can - even on city streets! He says it helps him stay relaxed. Greenfield is one of many people choosing a "barefoot life."
Until about 40,000 years ago, all humans went barefoot. As they walked, they developed calluses on the bottoms of their feet. These calluses protected the soles of their feet as they walked over rough surfaces, rocks, and sharp objects. When humans started wearing shoes, they wore thin-soled sandals.
People have different reasons for going barefoot. Australian Paul Thompson is a podiatrist. He started going barefoot to reduce pain. Thompson says that shoes prevent us from using some important muscles, while going barefoot makes these muscles stronger. Thompson also believes shoes make our feet less sensitive. The soles of our feet have nerve endings, which give the brain information about the best way to move; shoes just get in the way.
Each summer, Christiane Viehweger walks barefoot in the forest near her home in Germany. She says it helps her connect with nature. There are even "barefoot hiking paths," like one in Cornwall, England, where visitors walk barefoot over surfaces such as grass, sand, and wood.
But not everyone recommends the barefoot life. Some podiatrists say that a lot of barefoot walking puts too much stress on your feet. Greenfield says it's best to go barefoot a little at a time. Then see if you enjoy the barefoot life!

Paul Thompson is a foot doctor. Thompson goes barefoot, too. He started because his feet hurt. When he went barefoot, his feet stopped hurting! Thompson thinks shoes make us walk in an unnatural way. This is bad for our feet. He says shoes makes some muscles weak. Walking barefoot makes these muscles stronger.
But other foot doctors disagree. They say walking barefoot isn't safe; you can hurt yourself. Your feet can get an infection. They say walking barefoot can put too much pressure on your feet. Other doctors think it's good to go barefoot sometimes.
Kick off your shoes and see what you think of the barefoot life!





Do you have clothes that make you feel good? Dawnn Karen is a fashion psychologist. Karen studies how our clothing makes us feel. She says that wearing certain clothes puts us in a good mood. This is dopamine dressing.
Dopamine is a chemical in the brain. Dopamine tells the body how to feel. When you have a lot of dopamine, you feel happy. 
Karen says that yellow makes many people feel happy So, they wear yellow clothes to get into a good mood. Other people feel happy when they wear bright colors. But it's not only about color. Some people feel happy when they wear soft material, or when they wear patterns, like stripes.
Sometimes, even a kind of clothing can make you feel a certain way. Some people feel confident when they wear a suit. Memories are important too. A T-shirt may make you think of a happy memory. Then, when you wear the T-shirt, you feel happy.
Do you want to try dopamine dressing? Then go find something "happy" to wear!

In The Mood For Fashion
Lifestyle
Do you ever wake up feeling low on energy? Dawnn Karen, a fashion psychologist, suggests putting on a favorite piece of clothing. It can make you feel happier and give you more energy. It's also good for your mental health. Karen calls this dopamine dressing - wearing clothes that improve your mood.
Dopamine is a complicated chemical in our brains. It affects our feelings and behaviors. With dopamine dressing, you wear clothes that increase this "happy" chemical. Wearing certain colors, for example, can improve your mood. Karen says that most people associate yellow with joy and hope.
But it's not all about color. Certain patterns can make you feel good and connect with happy memories. Sometimes, the feeling of a certain fabric on your skin can put you in a good mood. For some people, wearing a certain type or style of clothing - like a suit - can make them feel stronger and more powerful. It is all very individual. Different pieces of clothing affect people in different ways.
Karen discusses this connection between clothing and mood in her book Dress Your Best Life. And there is research to back her up. A 2012 study at Northwestern University in Illinois, USA, showed that wearing certain clothes can change the way we feel and act. And a 2015 study at the University of Rochester in NY, USA, showed that color influences feelings. 
Do you want to try dopamine dressing? Karen has some advice. She suggests starting your day quietly thinking about how you want to feel. Then, go search your closet for the outfit to bring on that mood!

In The Mood For Fashion
Lifestyle
Do you know the saying, "When you look good, you feel good?" Fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen believes it 100 percent! Karen says that you can use what you wear to actively influence your mood. She calls this dopamine dressing. According to Karen, dopamine dressing makes you feel more confident, competent, and happy, and has a positive effect on your mental health.
And she's not alone. A 2012 study at Northwestern University in Illinois, USA, shows that wearing certain clothes can change the way we feel and act. It all depends on a person's personal associations. So, if you associate a certain T-shirt with a happy time or event in your life, then you will feel happy when you wear it. Similarly, a 2015 study at the University of Rochester in NY, USA, showed that certain colors can influence people's moods. Specific colors, explains Karen, correspond to specific emotions. One example she uses is yellow. Karen says it's a color many people connect to joy and hope.
Where did the term dopamine dressing come from? Karen has been credited with coining the phrase. Dopamine is a chemical in our brains - sometimes called the "happy hormone" - that affects our emotions, motivation, and behavior. Dopamine motivates a person to keep doing what makes them feel happy. So, dopamine dressing is choosing an outfit to intentionally raise the dopamine level in your brain, and boost your mood.
The phrase dopamine dressing is all over social media, often when displaying images of brightly-colored clothing. But dopamine dressing isn't just about color. The pattern on a piece of clothing can also connect someone to a happy memory. So can the feeling of a certain fabric against a person's skin. Some people find that wearing a certain style or article of clothing - like a suit - helps them feel more confident and powerful. Dopamine dressing is very individual.
Karen discusses the way clothes and mood are intertwined in a book she wrote called Dress Your Best Life. Karen's advice is to spend the first few minutes of your day, while you're still in bed, quietly thinking about the mood you want to have. Then, go search your closet for an outfit that fits!





During the pandemic, when many people were stuck indoors, their homes took on new functions - becoming schools and offices too. Nancy K. Keenan, an architect, realized that home design needed to change accordingly. So, in 2020, her team - along with researchers - conducted the America at Home Study. In the study, people were asked what changes they would like to see in their homes as a result of the pandemic. Then Keenan and her team designed a real-life "concept home," called Barnaby, which incorporates many of these changes.
Barnaby is a two-story home in North Carolina, USA. It's intended for a family with children, in which one parent works from home and the other works outside the home. The kitchen is in the center of the house, and is a place to cook, eat, work, and study. The kitchen table is designed as a homework station, and an area for kids to help prepare meals. There are low shelves that children can reach, encouraging them to be independent.
Barnaby has a quiet space for video calls, called the "Zoom room," and a "secret room," whose door is hidden behind a bookcase in a bedroom, for privacy. Another room can be used as a classroom, and afterwards a playroom; it has built-in desks, as well as storage for toys and games. There are also smaller, flexible spaces around the house that can be adapted for various activities, such as meditating, exercising, or watching movies.
The study showed that health at home is top priority. So, Barnaby's main entryway has a bathroom where people can wash their hands before entering. There's also a guest apartment - with its own kitchen - separate from the rest of the house, in case someone needs to quarantine. Barnaby has a front porch and a large, covered space in the back, so you can get fresh air - even if you can't leave the house.
Barnaby is currently open to visitors, and Keenan hopes it'll inspire others to create similar homes. But Barnaby will eventually be sold and used as a regular home. "It's a home built for how people want to live in today's world," says Keenan, "and we can't wait for people to experience it."

Welcome Home!
Lifestyle
During the pandemic, many people stayed at home for weeks. Homes became schools, offices, and places to "hang out." This made architect Nancy K. Keenan think of something: designers should build homes that fit these changes. So, in 2020, she worked with researchers on the America at Home Study. In the study, researchers asked people what changes they would want in their homes after experiencing the pandemic. Then, Keenan created a real home based on their answers. The house, called Barnaby, is in North Carolina, USA.
Barnaby is a house for a family. In the middle, is a child-friendly kitchen. It's a place to cook, eat, work, and study. Children can do homework or help prepare food at the table. There are low shelves that younger children can reach, so they can do things on their own.
Barnaby has a quiet "Zoom room" for video calls. There's a room that can first be used as a classroom, and then a playroom; it has desks, and places for toys and games. There are also open spaces around the house. They can be used for exercising, watching movies, or other activities.
To help keep the family healthy, Barnaby's main entryway has a bathroom. You can wash your hands before you go into the main house. There's also a separate apartment for guests, with its own kitchen. Someone who needs to quarantine can stay there. Barnaby has a large, covered space in the backyard, so you can "go outside" - even if you can't leave the house.
People can visit Barnaby. Keenan hopes it will inspire other home designers. One day, Barnaby will be used as a real home.

During the pandemic, people stayed home for many weeks. Adults worked at home. Children learned at home. Homes were crowded!
Nancy K. Keenan is an architect. She says homes need to be different now, because of the pandemic. For example, families need more space. So, Keenan designed a house called Barnaby. 
Barnaby has a very large kitchen. It's easy for adults and children to cook together. You can eat at the kitchen table. But it's also a place to work. Adults work. Children do homework. Barnaby also has smaller rooms. The small "Zoom room" is very quiet. It's a special room for video calls.
Some rooms are flexible. The family can use them in different ways. One room is a classroom. Then, it is a playroom. There are desks for class. There are shelves with toys and games.
Barnaby has a bathroom near the front door. First, people wash their hands. Then, they go inside the house.
You can visit Barnaby. It is in North Carolina, USA. Keenan hopes more people will make houses like Barnaby.




Digital Fashion
Lifestyle
Usually, people make clothing with material. They sew pieces of material together. But now, there is digital clothing. People use computers to design digital clothing. You "wear" digital clothing only online. For example, you can post a picture of yourself on social media. In the picture it looks like you're wearing the clothes. But you're not really wearing them.
You buy digital fashion online. First, you go to a digital fashion company's Web site. They have shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes, and accessories. Next, you order something you like. Then, you send a photo of yourself to the Web site. After a few days, you get the photo back. It's a picture of you wearing the digital clothing! Now, you can put the picture on social media.
Making real clothes is bad for the environment. Digital clothing solves this problem. Digital clothes also cost less than real clothing. Maybe someday, we'll all have digital closets to hold our digital clothes!

Lifestyle
Recently, writer Christian Allaire got a new outfit. It has green pants and a long black coat. Allaire posted a photo of his new clothes on social media. What's special about his outfit? It doesn't really exist! Allaire was wearing digital clothes. Digital clothes aren't made of cloth or material. They're made using computer technology!
Just like with traditional fashion, you can buy shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes, and accessories - only digital versions. The difference is that with digital clothes, you can't touch what you buy. You can only "wear" the clothes online. You can post a picture of yourself wearing the clothes on social media, for example.
One benefit to digital clothing is that it's more sustainable than traditional clothing. Making clothes causes lots of pollution. And many people actually buy clothes to wear just once, to post on social media. With digital clothes people can get new outfits as often as they want, without harming the environment.
Another benefit is that designer clothing costs less when it's digital. For example, sneakers from the designer brand Gucci, usually cost hundreds of dollars. But a pair of digital Gucci sneakers sells for less than 20 dollars.
Digital clothing also "fits" each customer perfectly. To get your digital clothes, you upload a photo of yourself to a digital fashion company's app. They send you a photo with your digital outfit blended onto your body. Now, your picture is ready for posting!
Today, more and more people on the Internet are wearing digital clothing. Maybe one day, everyone will have some clothing that exists only online. What will you hang in your digital closet?

Writer Christian Allaire was thrilled with a new outfit he bought - silver and green pants and a long black coat with light green ribbons. He thought it made him look like a superhero. But like superheroes, Allaire's outfit doesn't really exist. Allaire was wearing digital clothing!
More and more people on the Internet are wearing digital (or 3-D) clothing. Digital clothing isn't made of real, tangible materials; designers create them using new computer technologies. As with traditional fashion items, you can buy digital shirts, dresses, pants, hats, shoes, and accessories. However, after you buy them, you can only "wear" your clothes online - by posting pictures of yourself on social media, for example.
Why choose clothing made of pixels rather than textiles? One reason is the environment. According to a recent UK study, almost one in ten British people have admitted to having bought clothes to wear as a "one-off" outfit to post on social media. But producing clothing creates a lot of pollution. With digital clothing, this isn't a problem. People can get new and exciting outfits as often as they want. And for people who buy designer fashion items, digital clothing is a bargain. A real pair of Gucci sneakers costs hundreds of dollars, while a digital pair costs less than 20 dollars!
Another benefit of digital clothing is that it's customized to each person, so it "fits" perfectly. Customers upload a photo of themselves to the digital fashion company's app or Web site. Then, they receive a photo with their outfit professionally edited onto their bodies - and ready for posting.
Digital clothing allows designers to be extremely creative. They can create outfits with features that can't exist in the real world. Imagine clothes that are made of water, change colors, or have animated words or patterns! "The possibilities are endless and fun," says Stephy Fung, a digital fashion designer.
Like regular clothing, digital clothing can take time to make. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for customers to receive their digitally augmented photo. But in the future, the process could happen instantly. Perhaps someday, everyone will have some items of clothing that exist only online. Get ready to start shopping for your digital closet!





On a steep hill next to Germany's Lahn River sits the charming city of Marburg. Tourists enjoy the historic architecture of this fairy-tale town. And students come from around the world to go to its university. But most interesting about Marburg is the fact that it's a Blindenstadt ("blind city") � a city adapted to people who are blind or visually impaired.
Marburg is home to Blindenstudienanstalt, commonly called "Blista." Blista is a school for children and young people who are blind or visually impaired. After graduating from Blista, many students stay in Marburg to live, perhaps working or going to university. As a result, the blind population of Marburg is constantly growing, and the city has become a hub for them. Some blind residents call Marburg their "Capital City." 
Marburg is helpful to blind people in all different ways. Traffic lights make beeping sounds to let them know when it's safe to cross the street. At "talking" bus stops, they can hear information about bus arrivals. Bus drivers are trained to help too, by stopping right in front of a waiting blind passenger, for example, and letting them know which seats are empty.
For blind people who use a cane to walk around the city, Marburg's streets and sidewalks have small bumps and ridges. As the person walks, they tap the sidewalk with their cane. The bumps and ridges let them know they're approaching an obstacle or dangerous area.
More than 30 local restaurants in the Blindenstadt offer menus in Braille, and buildings such as the Ahrens department store have raised maps and floor plans. There are special tours of Marburg for blind people, where they can feel their way around miniature models of major city attractions.
One of these attractions is the six-kilometer Marburg Planetary Trail, where visitors encounter tactile models of the planets, along with explanations in Braille. The city also has many sports activities adapted for blind people, such as horseback riding, soccer, and skiing.
And Marburg continues to make the city more accessible, creating an even better and stronger Blindenstadt. Living in such a supportive community is inspiring. As one former Blista student says, "It gives you courage; it makes you dare to try out new things."

Marburg is helpful to its blind residents in many ways. The city's traffic lights make noises to let them know when it's safe to cross the street. "Talking" bus stops, give information about bus schedules. And when a blind person gets on a bus, the driver directs him or her to the closest free seat.

Want to Create? Take a Walk!
Lifestyle
Walking helps us relax. Walking also helps us think in creative ways.
 Authors need to be creative all the time. But thinking of new ideas is hard. Famous authors L.M. Montgomery and Ernest Hemingway took long walks. They said it helped them think of new ideas. 
Steve Jobs also took walks to think better. Jobs had "walking meetings" at his company, Apple, Inc. Jobs and his employees walked and talked. Other companies have walking meetings too. They say employees think of better ideas when they walk.
Scientists also say that walking makes people creative. Some scientists say the right side of the brain is the "thinking" side. The left side of the brain is the "creative" side. Usually, one side of the brain works harder than the other. But when you walk, both sides of your brain work together. This is good for your imagination.
So, the next time you want to be creative, take a nice, long walk!

Want to Create? Take a Walk!
Lifestyle
You probably know that going for a long walk helps you feel calm and relaxed. But did you know that it can make you more creative as well?
Many great thinkers of the past have benefited from the act of walking. Philosopher Aristotle used to walk around while teaching his students. Scientist Nikola Tesla took long daily walks to help him focus his ideas. And when authors such as L.M. Montgomery and Ernest Hemingway had writer's block, they would go on walks too.
Modern businesses are also benefiting from walking. Apple, Inc. founder Steve Jobs was known for holding walking meetings. He believed they helped people come up with more creative solutions to problems. Today, many employers find walking meetings more productive than "sit-down" meetings. Walking gives your brain a break from its regular patterns of thinking. This leads to new, creative ideas.
Science supports the walking-creativity connection. For example, in a study at the University of Graz, in Austria, researchers found that people who walked for exercise were more innovative than those who didn't. And a Stanford University study showed that creative thinking is enhanced while walking and for a short time afterward. One reason given is that the right side of the brain is the "logical" side, and the left side of the brain is the "creative" side. When you walk, both sides of your brain work together and communicate with each other.
So, head outside for a walk and get your creative juices flowing!

Want to Create? Take a Walk!
Lifestyle
You're taking a walk one morning. You get into a rhythm, and begin to "zone out." Soon, you're hardly aware that you're walking at all. You're feeling calm, relaxed, and creative. Solutions to problems are forming in your head. Sounds familiar? You're in good company!
Throughout the centuries, many great philosophers, scientists, and writers have benefited from the act of walking. Philosopher Aristotle used to pace back and forth while teaching his students. Scientist Nikola Tesla took long daily walks to help him focus his ideas before sitting down and writing. Authors L.M. Montgomery and Ernest Hemingway said that walking cured their writer's block.
Today, businesses are also getting into the act. Instead of holding meetings indoors, many entrepreneurs are taking meetings outside the office, while walking. They believe these "walking meetings" are more productive than traditional sit-down meetings. This idea was popularized by Apple, Inc. founder Steve Jobs. Jobs would insist on walking meetings, especially when he needed to think differently to solve a problem. Walking gives your brain a break, and gets you out of your usual thought patterns, leading to new, creative ideas.
Science supports this idea - that the imagination is enhanced by physical activity, especially walking. According to one theory, walking creates "whole-brain" thinking. The left side of the brain, which is associated with logical thinking, controls movement of the right side of the body. The right side of the brain, associated with creativity, controls the left side of the body. When you walk, both sides of your brain communicate with each other, moving you from one foot to the other and causing logical and creative thoughts to flow.
In a study at the University of Graz, in Austria, researchers found that active people who walked for exercise came up with more innovative ways to complete a drawing than sedentary people. A Stanford University study showed that creative thinking improves not only while walking, but shortly thereafter too.
We know that exercise helps keep our brains healthy. Now, we're starting to understand that putting one foot in front of the other can help our brains be more creative, as well. So, leave your computer inside, and head out for an energizing brain break!





Norway's long, dark winters and short days of sunlight come with average temperatures below -6 degrees C. You might think Norwegians pass the winter sipping hot cocoa in front of warm fires, but actually they love to go outdoors and enjoy their natural, frozen landscape. Whether the cold weather is wet or snowy, being outdoors is so much a part of the lifestyle, that there are "Right to Roam" laws, which allow Norwegians to walk almost anywhere they want - as long as they respect their surroundings. Norwegians even have a special name for being outdoors in nature: friluftsliv (pronounced free-loofts-leev), meaning "open-air living."
The term, which was first used by writer Henrik Ibsen in a poem about hiking and living in the Norwegian wilderness, involves embracing the cold outdoors instead of avoiding it. Surprisingly, it's good for you! Having a positive attitude toward wintertime helps people stay healthy. "You get kind of a time-out from cellphones and computers... being outdoors and in nature. It's one of the best places to relax," says Lasse Heimdal, the head of Norsk Friluftsliv, an organization for friluftsliv groups in Norway. In addition to improving physical health, research shows that being outside can increase your feeling of well-being, so it makes perfect sense that Norwegians are a very happy people. In fact, the UN's World Happiness Report lists Norway as one of the ten happiest countries in the world.
Is friluftsliv for everyone? Of course! Even children can participate. You don't need special equipment - just warm, comfortable clothing. You don't have to be an athlete either, since there's no skiing or ice skating required. Taking long walks with friends, having a picnic, or going for a leisurely bike ride are all friluftsliv activities that anyone can do. For some people, drinking a cup of tea bundled up in a parka is enough, and Heimdal says that's just fine.
The COVID-19 crisis has caused indoor activities to be restricted around the world, but the outdoors is one of the safest places for socializing. That's another reason to try friluftsliv. So, grab your warmest coat, and get ready to try friluftsliv. As the Norwegian saying goes, "There's no bad weather, only bad clothing!"

Winter Is the Perfect Time for Friluftsliv
Lifestyle
In Norway, winters are long, and it often gets as cold as -6 degrees C. Do you think Norwegians sit at home drinking hot chocolate and trying to stay warm? Actually, Norwegians love to go outdoors and enjoy nature - even in cold, wet, or snowy weather! Norwegians have a special name for being outdoors in nature: friluftsliv (pronounced free-loofts-leev). Friluftsliv means "open-air living."
With friluftsliv, you embrace the cold outdoors. You don't hide from it. This type of positive thinking can help you stay healthy. "You get kind of a time-out from cellphones and computers... being outdoors and in nature. It's one of the best places to relax," says Lasee Heimal. Heimal runs Norsk Friluftsliv, a friluftsliv group in Norway. Being outdoors is also good for your mood, not just your physical health. Maybe that's one reason that Norway is one of the ten happiest countries in the world, according to the UN's World Happiness Report.
Is friluftsliv for everyone? Of course! Children can do it, too. You don't have to do winter sports like skiing or ice skating, and you don't need any special equipment. Just make sure to wear warm, comfortable clothing. Take a long walk with friends, have a picnic, or go for a bike ride. These are all friluftsliv activities.
During the COVID-19 crisis, people are spending a lot of time indoors. But the outdoors is one of the safest places for socializing. That's another reason to try friluftsliv.

It is important for people to spend time outdoors. It's healthy for their bodies and their minds. That's why friluftsliv is good for people. Friluftsliv also makes people feel happy. Are you feeling sad or bored? Try friluftsliv. You will feel better!
Are you thinking, "I'm not good at sports"? Don't worry. Anyone can do friluftsliv. Children can do it, too. You don't need skis. You don't need ice skates. Just go outdoors! Is it -6 degrees C outside? That's okay. Go outdoors anyway! Just remember one thing: wear warm clothing. In Norway, people say, "There's no bad weather, only bad clothing!"




The Auntie Sewing Squad

People around the world are wearing masks because of COVID-19. But in some places, it's hard to find masks. Now, a group of volunteers is helping people get masks. How? They are sewing them! Meet the Auntie Sewing Squad!
Kristina Wong started the Auntie Sewing Squad. Wong is an actress in Los Angeles, California. But she isn't working now, because of COVID. So, Wong has a lot of free time. She also has a lot of fabric. Wong uses the fabric to make masks.
Wong sewed a mask. She wore the mask on social media. Wong asked if people wanted one. Hundreds of people said yes! Wong needed help. She looked for volunteers on social media to help her sew them.
At first, 26 people joined the squad. Today, there are more than 800 sewers (or "aunties"). There are sewers in Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and other states. They made more than 50,000 masks!  And now, the squad also gives out diapers and cleaning supplies! They want to help in any way that they can.

Today, millions of people around the world are wearing masks during the COVID-19 crisis. But in some areas of the US, masks can be hard to find. Now, a group of volunteers is trying to help. Volunteers all over the US are sewing and delivering masks to people who need them. Meet the Auntie Sewing Squad!
 
Actress Kristina Wong started the Auntie Sewing Squad in Los Angeles, California. Wong had a lot of fabric at home because she used it to make props for her shows. Due to the crisis, all her shows were cancelled. So, she decided to use her free time (and fabric) to make masks. Wong posted a photo of one of her colorful masks on social media. She offered to mail people free masks. Hundreds of people replied! Wong quickly realized that she couldn't fill all the orders herself. She sent a message on social media asking for sewing help. And the Auntie Sewing Squad was born!
Starting with just 26 volunteers, Wong's group now has more than 800 sewers across the US. Today, the group helps communities where people don't have enough money to buy masks. This includes farmworkers, immigrants and Native Americans. In addition to masks, the Auntie Sewing Squad distributes other supplies, such as diapers, and cleaning products.
Currently, there are sewers - or "aunties" - in Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and other US states. So far, the group has donated more than 55,000 masks! Wong isn't sure how long the Auntie Sewing Squad will continue working. But she says that as long as people in vulnerable communities need masks, the squad will keep sewing!

"I can't donate money, but I can donate masks," says Gina Rivera, a stay-at-home mom from California, USA. Rivera started making masks as a way to feel useful while in lockdown. Wearing masks has become a very important part of daily life for people around the world. But in some areas of the US, there are mask shortages. Rivera sews about 100 masks per week as part of the Auntie Sewing Squad, a major volunteer project that sews and delivers fabric masks to people who need them.
The Auntie Sewing Squad was started by actress Kristina Wong in Los Angeles, California. Due to the pandemic, all of Wong's performances were cancelled. So, Wong decided to put her creative energy into helping people who didn't have access to masks. Wong had a lot of fabric at home because she used it to make props for her shows. She took out her Hello Kitty sewing machine, and began turning the fabric into masks. Then, Wong posted a photo of herself in one of her colorful masks on social media, along with an offer to mail people free masks. She received hundreds of requests.
Wong began making masks for medical workers. But after less than a week, she realized she couldn't do it alone. So, she sent out a call for help on social media, and was flooded by responses from volunteers ready to lend a hand (and a needle!). Then, Wong launched a Facebook group called the Auntie Sewing Squad. Starting with just 26 volunteers, the group now has more than 800 sewers across the US. Today, the group helps communities where people - including farmworkers, immigrants and Native Americans - don't have enough money to purchase masks. And now, in addition to masks, the Auntie Sewing Squad distributes other essentials, such as diapers and cleaning products.
Currently, sewers - or "aunties"- in Arizona, Oregon, Florida, and other US states are sewing like crazy. So far, they have distributed more than 55,000 masks!

Restaurants around the world have had to close due to the COVID-19 crisis. But now, as countries emerge from lockdown, more people are getting out of the house to socialize. A good place to socialize is at restaurants, but restaurants are only allowed to reopen if they follow strict social distancing rules. These rules include keeping diners at least two meters apart from each other. To accomplish this, restaurant owners are coming up with creative solutions!
To keep diners at the proper distance, many restaurants limit the number of customers who may eat inside at one time. This has inspired owners to fill the empty spaces in interesting ways. Some restaurants, such as the one at Japan's Izu Shabonten Zoo, are putting stuffed animals or dolls in the empty seats. One restaurant is taking this concept even further. The Inn at Little Washington in Virginia, USA is seating life-sized mannequins at their empty tables. These mannequins, stylishly dressed in 1940's era clothing, are treated just like any other customer. Servers bring them drinks and interact with them, so the restaurant doesn't feel quite so empty! 
In other areas, customers may only eat outside the main restaurant. An intimate experience awaits at the Dutch restaurant, Mediamatic Eten. Customers sit on the patio overlooking the marina, in small glass greenhouses just big enough for two or three people. This keeps small groups of diners away from each other. Servers slide the food onto the table using long pieces of wood, keeping their distance from diners, too.
The owners of Fish Tales, in Maryland, USA, are putting one-person "bumper tables" in their 279-square-meter parking lot. Bumper tables are round tables on wheels with a hole in the middle and a large inner tube around the edge. Diners stand in the center of the table. The inner tube is so wide that it keeps diners far apart. Diners roll their table around to interact with others at a safe distance. Some other restaurant parking lots, from Germany to South Korea, are being transformed into drive-in movie theaters. At the Butler House in Texas, USA, customers text their order to the servers. Then they enjoy a movie with their meals - delivered directly to their car! 
Who knows what innovations we'll see next, as restaurants continue to find new ways to stay open while practicing safe social distancing!

Social Distancing Gets Creative

Do you miss restaurants? Because of the COVID-19 crisis, restaurants around the world have been closed. But now, restaurants are starting to reopen according to new safety rules. Social distancing means people must stay at least two meters apart from each other. How can people go to restaurants and still stay safe? Restaurants are getting creative!
In some areas, restaurants must limit the number of customers eating inside at one time. Some restaurants put stuffed animals or dolls in the empty seats. This makes the restaurant feel fuller. One restaurant, the Inn at Little Washington, in Virginia, USA is putting mannequins dressed in costumes at the empty tables. Servers treat them just like any other customers. They even talk to the mannequins, and bring them drinks!
In other areas, customers must sit outside the main restaurant. The Dutch restaurant Mediamatic Eten has small glass greenhouses. Two or three diners can sit in each greenhouse. This keeps small groups of diners away from each other. Servers keep their distance too, by serving the meal on a long, flat piece of wood.
A restaurant called Fish Tales, in Maryland, USA, put "bumper tables" in their parking lot. Bumper tables are inner tubes on wheels. Diners stand in the middle of the tube. The inner tube is so wide that customers are always two meters apart; diners can roll their tables around to interact with each other at a safe distance.
Some restaurants turned their parking lots into drive-in movie theaters. At the Butler House in Texas, USA, food is brought out to customers' cars while they watch a movie.

Mattel, Inc. is a toy company. They made the first Barbie doll in 1959. She was tall and thin. She wore a swimsuit. The first Barbie also had light skin, and blonde or brown hair.
Today, millions of children around the world play with Barbie dolls. But people don't agree about some things. For example, is Barbie good for girls? Barbie has a "perfect" body. Does this make young girls feel bad about their bodies?
In the past, people said Barbies weren't diverse. So, in 1980, Mattel made Hispanic Barbie. Next, they made dolls of other races. Then, in 2016, Mattel made Fashionista Barbie. There are 176 different Fashionista dolls. Some are tall, some are short, and some are "curvy." They have many different skin colors. One Fashionista uses a wheelchair.
Today, Barbie is over 60 years old. She has lots of clothes, friends, and accessories. And now, there are Barbie "Sheroes." These Barbies look like famous women from around the world. So, what's next for Barbie?

It's a New Barbie World
Lifestyle
Did you ever play with Barbie dolls? Barbie was "born" in 1959. This tall, thin doll wore a swimsuit and had light skin, and blonde or brown hair. Later, Barbie got clothes, accessories, and friends. Millions of children all over the world love this iconic doll.
In addition to Barbie's success, there were controversies. For example, Barbie's body caused controversy because real bodies don't look like hers. People worried that playing with Barbies might make girls feel bad about their own bodies. When Teen Talk Barbie was created in 1992, people criticized her because she said things like, "I love shopping!" and "Math is tough!"
People also criticized Mattel, Inc., the company that makes Barbie, because they thought Barbies weren't diverse enough. So, in 1980 Mattel started making Hispanic dolls. Later, they added dolls of other ethnicities. Barbie also got more than 200 inspiring jobs such as doctor, astronaut, and musician.
Then, in 2016, Mattel started making Fashionista Barbie. Mattel wanted to make each child feel like there was a doll just for her. So, there are 176 Fashionista dolls with nine different body types - tall, short, and a "curvy" body, which isn't very thin. Fashionista Barbies have 35 skin colors, and 94 hairstyles. One doll uses a wheelchair. Another has vitiligo, which means some parts of her skin are dark and some are lighter.
Today, Barbie is over 60 years old, but Mattel keeps creating new types. Barbie "Sheroes" (she + heroes) look like important women from the past and present. Tennis player Naomi Osaka, and ballerina Misty Copeland are both Sheroes. As the dolls continue to change, it seems like there's no stopping Barbie!

It's a New Barbie World
Lifestyle
Since the first Barbie doll arrived in stores in 1959, millions of children in more than 150 countries around the globe have played with them. The original Barbie had light skin and blonde or brunette hair. She was tall and slim and wore a swimsuit. Some 350,000 dolls were sold in that first year - the beginning of a phenomenon. And, of course, it wasn't just the doll for sale. Soon after, Barbie came with clothes, friends, accessories... a whole Barbie world.
However, along with Barbie's success through the years came controversies. The doll's unrealistic body, for example, was blamed for young girls having problems with body image. When Teen Talk Barbie arrived in 1992, she was criticized for saying things like, "I love shopping!" and "Math is tough!"
Barbie's lack of diversity also caused controversy. Mattel, Inc., the company that makes Barbie, responded with change. In 1980, Mattel produced Hispanic dolls, which were followed by dolls of different races and ethnicities. To promote Barbie as a role model for girls, she began to appear in a range of professions, including doctor, astronaut, firefighter, and rap musician. In fact, since Barbie's original job as "teenage fashion model," Barbie has had some 200 different careers!
Then, in 2016, to increase diversity and let every girl own a doll she could identify with, Mattel released Barbie Fashionista dolls, each with her own look and style. According to Barbie's Web site, there are 176 Fashionista dolls with nine different body types including tall, petite, and curvy, as well as 35 skin tones and 94 hairstyles. Later, dolls with physical disabilities, including a Barbie with a prosthetic leg and one in a wheelchair, were added. Mattel also wanted to include children with various conditions, so dermatologists helped create a Barbie with vitiligo, a condition that gives a person's skin "patches" of lighter and darker color.
For more than 60 years, Barbie has been an icon in the doll business. Mattel continues to inspire young girls with their "Sheroes" (she + heroes) line, which includes dolls modeled after extraordinary women from the past and present, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka and ballerina Misty Copeland. As the dolls continue to evolve, it seems like there's no stopping Barbie!

Regina Boi lives on the Italian island of Sardinia, where she works in a community bakery with eleven other women. Boi, who is in her eighties, lives in one of the world's "Blue Zones" - areas where people tend to live longer than other places - and the residents often live to celebrate their 100th birthdays!
While working for National Geographic magazine, explorer Dan Buettner noticed that there are specific places in the world where people live longer than the average. He called the areas Blue Zones and identified five of them: Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Icaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California, USA.
In addition to living longer, Buettner found that people in Blue Zones are happier and healthier. According to Buettner, their culture and way of life are responsible for this, not their genes. Buettner found that residents of Blue Zones have certain things in common, such as their diet. They all drink a lot of tea and water, and eat very little meat. Instead, their mostly plant-based diet includes a lot of vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Additionally, people in Blue Zones do a lot of physical activity. They don't go to the gym, but get exercise from routine tasks such as gardening, walking places rather than driving, and doing household chores.
Another thing people in Blue Zones have in common is being social. "You can't walk outside your front door in these regions without bumping into somebody you know, and this is all so much more powerful than we think," explains Buettner. In Blue Zone communities, grandparents often live with their children and grandchildren, which studies show can increase longevity. Elderly people are valued members of the community who continue to contribute - just like Boi, who still runs the whole bakery!
Buettner has brought Blue Zone principles to communities across the United States with his Blue Zones Project. By working with policy makers, local businesses, schools and individuals, the project has helped increase life expectancy in Blue Zones Project communities. So, what's Buettner's advice for those of us who don't live in Blue Zones? He says we should make healthier choices.
As the Sardinians say, "May you live to 100!"

Thousands of years ago in North America, Native Americans did not buy their food in a store. They grew their food.  They ate rice, corn and squash. They also hunted animals for meat. They made many different things to eat. We call Native American food "indigenous" food. Today, Native American food is becoming popular again.
Andi Murphy and Mariah Gladstone are Native American chefs. Murphy has a Web site called Toasted Sister. Gladstone has a Web site called Indigikitchen. They have recipes and videos on their Web sites. You can learn to cook Native American dishes. You can learn about Native American traditions too.

Maizie White is also a Native American with a food Web site. It is called NativeHearth. She writes about indigenous food. There are recipes on her Web site too. Why is Maizie special? She's only in seventh grade!

In the USA, people are becoming more interested in indigenous foods. Today, thanks to the growing number of Native American chefs and the Internet, indigenous foods of Native Americans are becoming more popular.
There are 566 Native American tribes that have been living in America for thousands of years. Andi Murphy is part of the Navajo tribe. You can watch her cooking videos online. In the videos, she prepares Native American food. Murphy also interviews chefs and farmers from around the US on her podcast, Toasted Sister. They talk about where Native American food comes from, and the traditions around it.
Mariah Gladstone, from the Blackfeet tribe, also uses the Internet to teach people about her culture's food. In the past, Native Americans only ate things that came from nature. For example, they ate meat (especially bison), wild rice, corn, and squash. Gladstone has a Web site called Indigikitchen. On Indigikitchen's online cooking show, Gladstone prepares Native American food including sweet wild rice with berries, blue cornmeal pancakes and butternut squash with bison. Gladstone teaches cooking classes and visits schools. She wants to educate people and get them excited about eating indigenous foods.
Blogs and cookbooks are helping to make Native American food more popular. Recently, Sean Sherman's cookbook, The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, was named "The Best American Cookbook". Sherman wants to encourage younger chefs. He invited Maizie White, a seventh grader from the Mohawk tribe, to cook with him. Maizie has her own blog called NativeHearth where she posts recipes and writes about indigenous food.

Welcome to Indigenous Cooking
Lifestyle
For thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in North America, Native Americans developed their own culture and lifestyle. Today in the USA, people are becoming interested in the foods that the indigenous people ate at that time. Thanks to a growing number of Native American chefs and the Internet, Native American food, known as "the first truly American cuisine," is being revived.
Native Americans in the USA come from 566 recognized tribes. Food journalist Andi Murphy, a member of the Navajo tribe, says, "I want to show the beauty and simplicity of Native food." In addition to creating online videos of Native dishes being prepared, Murphy hosts Toasted Sister, a podcast where she interviews chefs, farmers and foodies from around the USA. The discussions focus on the development of Native American cuisine, and how food connects Native Americans to their origins and traditions.   
Mariah Gladstone, from the Blackfeet tribe, also uses the Internet to celebrate her culture's food through her Web site, Indigikitchen. In the past, Native Americans had a varied diet that Gladstone explains "came from the land," including meat (especially bison), wild rice, corn, and squash. On Indigikitchen's online cooking show, Gladstone prepares dishes that combine indigenous foods with modern ingredients. In some of her more popular videos, she makes sweet wild rice with berries, blue cornmeal pancakes, and butternut squash with bison. Additionally, Indigikitchen runs cooking workshops and school programs, and supports Native American food producers. Gladstone's goal is to teach people about indigenous foods, and to get Native and non-Native Americans excited about eating them. She also hopes eating traditional foods will improve Native Americans' health. For example, as a result of their changing diets, many Native Americans have developed diabetes.
Blogs and cookbooks are helping to popularize Native American cuisine. Recently, Chef Sean Sherman's cookbook, The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, won a national prize for best American cookbook. Sherman wants to encourage younger chefs. He invited Maizie White, a seventh grader from the Mohawk tribe, to come cook with him in New York. Maizie, who has her own blog called NativeHearth, posts recipes and writes about Native American food traditions.

Welcome To The Doodle House!
Arts & Entertainment
Have you ever drawn simple pictures or designs during a work meeting or during a class? Then you've doodled! When Sam Cox was nine years old, he doodled on his bedroom wall. Many people outgrow doodling, but Cox never did; he became a successful British artist. Cox's childhood dream was to live in a house completely covered in doodles. Recently, with the "Doodle House," he made his dream come true!
The Doodle House looks very different from other houses in Kent, England. It has been doodled, inside and out! Cox's art looks like cute, black-on-white cartoons. He uses simple, thick lines to create symbols and characters wearing funny expressions. Cox bought the 13-room home in 2019. Then, he covered every bit of it with white paint - he used 900 liters! Next, Cox grabbed a black marker and started doodling on the white surfaces. He began upstairs in the main bedroom, and then moved on to the bathroom. Eventually, he finished the entire upper floor. Cox spent almost two years drawing over every square centimeter of the house!
Cox didn't only doodle on the walls, floors and ceilings of the house - he doodled on the furnishings too! Doodled beds have doodled blankets and pillows. In the kitchen, the stove and refrigerator have been doodled. The dining room chairs and table have doodles. Cox doodled the sofa in his living room as well as the television! Finally, when Cox had finished all the rooms in the house, he used 401 cans of black spray paint to add doodles to the outside!
Each part of the Doodle House has a theme. In the bedroom, flowers, stars and other characters get ready for bed. Fish and other sea creatures float around a water-themed bathroom, along with a giant toothbrush. There's even a "thinking" room filled with fluffy clouds!
Cox (known as "Mr. Doodle") loves living in the Doodle House with his wife Alena ("Mrs. Doodle"), and their dog, "We think it's really fun," he says. The public can't visit yet, but there is an online video Cox made using the nearly 2,000 photos he took while painting the house. "I am so excited that my doodles now have a permanent home in the UK," says Mr. Doodle.

Do you bake cakes? Each year, the Blanton Museum of Art (in Texas, USA) has a baking contest. It's called the Great Blanton Bake-Off. The museum started the contest during the COVID pandemic. It helped people get excited about the museum.
The museum has more than 19,000 pieces of art. To enter the contest, choose your favorite piece of art on the museum's Web site. Then, bake and decorate your cake. Make it look like the artwork. Next, send the museum a photo of your cake. The museum shares all the photos online. People vote for the cake they think looks the best. Some contestants bake just for fun. Others are professional bakers. Contestants can be any age. Winners get prizes.
Lois Rodriguez baked a cake that looked like the sculpture The Barefoot Clown. The cake looked like a foot. Georgia Chido is a teenager. She made a chocolate cake with a colorful pattern. It looked like artwork by artist Luis Montiel. Chido's cake won a prize! Can you make a cake "masterpiece"?

Like many museums around the world, the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, USA, was closed during the COVID pandemic. Back then, the only way to "visit" the artwork was online. But the museum wanted to keep people interested in their collection - more than 19,000 pieces of artwork. So, they started a baking competition called the Great Blanton Bake-Off. In the competition, contestants choose a piece of art from the museum's collection. Then, they make a cake that looks like the artwork!
Bake-Off contestants send photos of their cakes to the museum. Then the museum shares the photos online. People look at the photos. They vote online for the cake they think looks the best. You don't have to be a professional baker to be in the competition. And contestants of all ages are welcome. Winners get prizes from local bakeries.
Fifteen-year-old Georgia Chido was a recent winner. She liked a tapestry by Venezuelan artist Luis Montiel. A tapestry is a piece of heavy cloth with a picture on it. Chido made a round, chocolate cake. Then, she used different colored food dyes to make the pattern from the tapestry. Lois Rodriguez made a vanilla cake shaped like a foot. She was inspired by the artwork The Barefoot Clown. Rodriguez says it was hard to make the colors on her cake match the colors in the artwork.
Lizabel Stella is the museum's social media manager, and the creator of the Bake-Off. She's thrilled with the success of the competition. "This is a completely new way for people to engage with art from our collection," she says.

You may have seen cake baking competitions on television or online. Perhaps you've seen the TV show where contestants bake cakes that look like everyday objects - from shoes to bottles of soap! But there's another creative cake competition you might have missed. It's run by the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, USA, and it's called the Great Blanton Bake-Off. In the competition, contestants bake cakes that look like pieces of artwork from the museum's collection!
The Great Blanton Bake-Off is the brainchild of Lizabel Stella, the museum's social media manager. Stella was looking for a way to keep people interested in art, and in the museum, when it was closed during the pandemic. During this time, Stella noticed that many people were posting baking videos on social media. This inspired Stella to create the Bake-Off.
For the Great Blanton Bake-Off, contestants create a cake that looks like one of the museum's more than 19,000 works of art. The collection includes European paintings, prints and drawings, and American and Latin American art. To choose a piece of artwork, participants can go to the museum, or browse the collection online.
When contestants finish their cakes, they take photos of their "masterpieces" and send them to the museum. Then, on World Baking Day (celebrated in May) the museum shares the photos online, and the public votes for the best-looking cake. Bake-Off winners receive prizes from local pastry shops, and memberships to the museum.
Recently, contestant Lois Rodriguez made a vanilla cake shaped like a foot. It was inspired by the sculpture The Barefoot Clown by artist Tr� Arenz. "Getting the colors close [to the original artwork] was a real challenge," says Rodriguez.
The contest is open to professional and amateur bakers of all ages. It took 15-year-old Georgia Chido two days to make her round, gluten-free cake with chocolate icing. Chido used different colored food dyes to recreate the pattern of a tapestry by Venezuelan artist Luis Montiel. Chido's cake won!
Stella is thrilled with the success of the Blanton Bake-Off. "This is a completely new way for people to engage with art from our collection," she says.





Ping Sie, from Singapore, never expected to find her picture in a fashion magazine. She has some wrinkles and never wears makeup. But after working in her family's business for many years, she decided to change careers. At age 58, Sie became a model. Sie is part of a shift in the modeling industry towards models who don't fit the idea of a "traditional" fashion model. These agencies want models who look "real," and have a great personality. They believe stressing a model's individuality makes them more interesting to people. At agency Web sites and on social media, you can find out how models spend their time away from the camera.
Most "traditional" models look fresh and young. "I would say once you're in your early 30's, it's time to 'hang up your high heels'," says Pat Kraal, the managing director of Platinum Angels Management (PAM). Based in Singapore, PAM is the first modeling agency in Asia whose models are all over the age of 50. With an emphasis on personality, PAM has almost no physical requirements to join. Kraal says PAM's models inspire people to look beyond a person's age. "It is not the end of the world just because you're 60 - it's just the beginning!"
Unlike PAM's models, who often have gray hair, models at Anti-Agency, in the UK, are more likely to have rainbow-colored hair - or no hair at all! Anti-Agency represents models with quirkier looks. Many of them have body piercings or tattoos - things usually frowned upon in traditional modeling. The agency looks for creative individuals, such as musicians and painters, who also have the talent to model. There are no height or weight requirements.
After working for other agencies for years, Rene Gonzalez decided to start State, a modeling agency for a new generation of models. Their roster of models includes people of all body types. Additionally, State expects their fashion models to be role models. Model Kendall Baisden, for example, was an honors student in college, is a star athlete, and wants to inspire people to follow their dreams.
When looking for models, unconventional modeling agencies work outside the standard idea of beauty. After all, beauty is only skin deep!

Ping Sie, from Singapore, has wrinkles and never wears makeup. But Sie just started a surprising new career. At age 58, she became a fashion model! Today, many advertisers are looking for untraditional models (who are not tall, thin, and young). So, more and more modeling agencies are finding work for untraditional fashion models. These agencies are searching for models with interesting looks and great personalities. They believe a model's personality makes them more interesting to advertisers. In fact, agency Web sites tell you how models spend their free time away from modeling.
The agency Sie works for is Platinum Angels Management (PAM). PAM is the first modeling agency in Asia whose models are all over the age of 50. Pat Kraal runs PAM. She hopes PAM's models will inspire people of all ages to enjoy life. "It is not the end of the world just because you're 60 - it's just the beginning!" says Kraal.
Similarly, Anti-Agency, a modeling agency in the UK, is more interested in a model's personality than in their appearance. The agency looks for musicians, painters, and other creative people. Unlike traditional models, many Anti-Agency models proudly show body piercings or tattoos. And models don't need to be a certain height or weight.
State modeling agency has models of all different body types too. But State also wants fashion models who people can look up to. For example, Kendall Baisden, one of their models, got top grades in college and is a professional athlete. Baisden wants to inspire people to follow their dreams.
As the fashion industry continues to change, model agencies will change too.

We see a lot of ads every day. The ads try to sell us things. Many ads use models. Most models are very tall and thin. Most models are young. But now, ads are changing. Companies want models that look like "real" people. So, modeling agencies are looking for all kinds of people. Some have wrinkles. Some have a lot of body piercings.
Platinum Angels Management is a modeling agency in Singapore. All their models are older than 50. The agency has a message: older people can enjoy life too!
Another special modeling agency is Anti-Agency. It is in the UK. Anti-Agency wants models who are creative. Some of their models are musicians. Some models are painters. Many models have tattoos.
At the State modeling agency, models have all different body types. But State also wants models who inspire people. So, they look for models with interesting lives. One model, Kendall, is an excellent student. She is also an athlete.

Most art museums don't show all their art. They don't have enough space. They put most art in storage. So, museum visitors don't see that art. Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen wants to show all their art at once (more than 151,000 objects). So, they built storage that people can visit. The new building is called the "Depot." It's in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
Inside, the Depot has lots of glass. The art is in glass display cases. The cases protect the art. Visitors walk over glass bridges. They also ride in glass elevators. Visitors watch restorers working behind glass walls. Restorers take care of the art, so it lasts a long time. The Depot has all kinds of art. There is furniture. There are ceramic objects. There are paintings by famous artists.
Outside, the Depot has mirrors all over it. People think the Depot looks like a giant silver bowl. The shiny building is 39.5 meters high. On top of the Depot there are trees and grass. There is also a restaurant. Visitors enjoy the Depot.

Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen is in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This famous museum has more than 151,000 pieces of artwork. Visitors can see all types of art - furniture, ceramics and paintings, including pieces by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and more. But the museum isn't large enough to show everything at once. In the past, most of the art was kept in different storage facilities.
But today, the museum has one big storage facility, called Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen. The "Depot" is the first art storage facility in the world to be open to the public, allowing visitors to view the museum's entire collection.
The 39.5 meters-high Depot is next to the main museum building. Its curved sides are covered in 1,664 mirrors, making it look like a giant silver bowl. On top of the Depot are trees and grass. There is also a restaurant with an amazing view of the city.
In the Depot, the art is organized in a special way - according to materials. Pieces of art made from the same materials are kept in the same compartment. Each compartment has a different climate. For example, paintings may be in one compartment and silver objects in another.
The Depot is filled with glass cases in different shapes and sizes. The cases protect the art, and allow visitors to see it. To view the art, visitors walk over glass bridges and climb stairs. They can also ride the glass elevators. Visitors can even look behind glass walls to watch art restorers at work, making sure the art stays in good condition. The Depot lets visitors experience art in a new and interesting way.

Like many world-famous art museums, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, in the Netherlands, had a space problem. Their building wasn't large enough to display all their artwork at once. Visitors were only able to view a small fraction (around 8%) of the collection. The rest of the more than 151,000 pieces were in various storage facilities. So, they came up with a unique solution - the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen. It's an art storage facility open to the public, which allows visitors to view the museum's entire collection.
The "Depot" looks like a giant silver bowl. Standing 39.5 meters high, the structure is covered in 1,664 mirrors. Its shiny, curved surface reflects the main museum building, which sits right next to the Depot. On top of the Depot, you'll find a rooftop forest with trees and grass, and a restaurant with a view of the Rotterdam cityscape.
It took 16 weeks to transfer all the precious pieces of art into the Depot. The museum's collection spans the history of Western art from the Middle Ages till today. There is furniture, ceramics, and paintings, including masterpieces by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and more.
In the main museum building, objects are organized by time period or art style. But in the Depot, they're organized according to the materials they're made from. There are sections for paintings, metal objects, organic and non-organic materials, and black-and-white and color photography. Each section has its own climate, to keep each type of material at the proper temperature, so the artwork is preserved.
Inside, the Depot is made mostly of glass and other transparent materials. There are glass display cases in different shapes and sizes, and stairs and glass elevators help people move around the building. You can see the exhibits at all angles, and even walk on top of them, or see them below from the glass bridges.
At the Depot, not only art is on display; the staff is too! There are four studios where curators, restorers, and other employees work behind glass walls. Visitors get a behind-the-scenes look at the activities involved in taking care of the artwork. At the Depot, visitors can not only view lots of art, but experience art in a new, and interesting way.




Very "Cool" Art

Simon Beck walks for kilometers through a field of thick snow in Norway. As he walks, he creates a huge, detailed design. Beck is an artist, and his "canvas" is snow.
Beck "draws" or "carves out" his designs by walking on top of the snow with snowshoes. Once, he drew a four-leaf clover on a frozen reservoir in France. It was the size of six soccer fields, and took him 32 hours to complete!
Beck made his first piece of snow art after a day of skiing in 2004. He went to a field of freshly fallen snow in the French alps, where he lived. Using a compass, he measured five points around a central point and joined the dots, creating a five-pointed star. After that first snow drawing, Beck kept going, making more complicated designs each time.
Beck always follows the same routine. He uses a compass as a guide, and carves out the main lines of the design. Then he fills in smaller lines and shades the outer part of the drawing.
Many of Beck's designs are geometric. He once drew a huge triangle with many smaller triangles inside it.
He also drew a 450-meter geometric snowflake, which took over six hours of work! But Beck draws in other styles too. In Canada, he made a wolf howling at the moon. In Siberia, he made a dragon with giant wings.
From above, some of Beck's designs look three-dimensional. Beck gets excited to see his finished creations from a high vantage point. "There's always a sense of anticipation," he says, "because you never really know what it's going to look like until you see it."
Beck has created snow art in countries around the globe. So far, he has created more than 370 snow drawings. And Beck is not limited to snow. He draws in sand too, using a rake instead of snowshoes to carve out designs. Beck has created about 200 sand drawings so far.
It doesn't bother the artist that his drawings get blown away by wind and washed away by water. But since they won't last forever, he photographs each piece. Although his artwork is temporary, Beck loves what he does, and plans to continue making art - one footprint at a time!

In 2004, Beck made his first snow drawing - a five-pointed star. First, he took a compass to an empty field of snow. Using the compass, Beck measured out even lines in the snow. Then, he began walking along the lines. As he walked, his feet "drew" the star. Since then, this artist has created more than 370 snow drawings.
Beck's designs are complex. Although they're all different, he makes them the same way each time. First, he makes the main lines of the design. Then, he adds smaller lines for detail. Finally, he does the outer part of the drawing. Many of Beck's designs are geometric, like the snowflake. From high above, some of his pictures even look three-dimensional.
Beck also draws creatures. In Canada, he drew a wolf. In Siberia, he drew a dragon with giant wings. Beck's art has been seen in the French Alps, Norway, and many other snowy places.
And Beck doesn't only draw in snow. He draws in sand too. He uses a rake to draw the designs instead of snowshoes. Beck has created about 200 sand drawings so far.
Beck's art is only temporary - snow melts and sand gets washed away - so Beck photographs each drawing. This way, his art never truly disappears.

Very "Cool" Art
Arts & Entertainment
Simon Beck loves the snow. He's a snow artist. Beck "draws" pictures in the snow with his feet and snowshoes.
First, Beck draws a picture on paper. Then, he goes to a space with lots of snow. Next, Beck looks at the picture, and draws it with his feet. When a line in the picture goes left, Beck walks left. When the picture shows a circle, Beck walks in a circle. Beck's snowshoes help him stay on top of the snow.
Beck's first snow picture was a star. He made the star in the French Alps, in 2004. Beck's pictures are very big. He may walk for many kilometers to make them. Once, Beck walked for six hours to draw a snowflake. It was 450-meters long!
Beck makes snow drawings all over the world. In Canada, he drew a wolf. In Siberia, he drew a dragon with large wings. Beck drew more than 370 snow drawings so far.
But snow melts, and Beck's art disappears. So, Beck photographs every snow drawing.




The Laughter Lab
Arts & Entertainment
What makes us laugh? Robin Dunbar wants to find out. Dunbar is a psychologist. He is studying laughter. Emma Stirling-Middleton works at the The Cartoon Museum in London. She also wants to learn about laughter. Stirling-Middleton asked Dunbar to help her create an exhibit at The Cartoon Museum. The exhibit is called Laughter Lab: What's So Funny?.
At the exhibit, there are many kinds of cartoons. Some cartoons are in black and white. Other cartoons are in color. The cartoons hang on the wall in pairs. Visitors look at a pair of cartoons. They decide which cartoon is funnier. Then they write this information down on a survey. They do this for every pair of cartoons. There are 19 pairs altogether.
Scientists will read the surveys. The surveys will tell scientists which cartoons made people laugh the most. Scientists will try to find out why.
Visit the Laughter Lab exhibit soon. You'll help scientists. And best of all, you'll laugh!

The Laughter Lab

Do you like funny drawings, called cartoons? You can see many cartoons, from all different time periods, at The Cartoon Museum, in London. The museum has more than 6,000 original cartoons. Recently, curators chose some of these pieces for an interesting exhibit, called Laughter Lab: What's So Funny? The exhibit is also an experiment. Its purpose is to find out what makes us laugh, and why we laugh at some cartoons and not others.
At the Laughter Lab, visitors see a variety of cartoons. Some are in black and white. Others are in color. The cartoons are arranged in sets of two. Each cartoon in a pair is marked with an "A" or "B." Visitors walk around the exhibit. From each pair, they pick the cartoon they think is funnier. Then, they write "A" or "B" on the survey. When the exhibit ends, after six months, scientists will study the results.
The Laughter Lab was created by Robin Dunbar and Emma Stirling-Middleton. Dunbar is a University of Oxford psychologist. Stirling-Middleton is a curator of The Cartoon Museum. The Laughter Lab was Stirling-Middleton's idea. "I thought... it would be really nice to do an exhibition looking at laughter," she says.
At first, Stirling-Middleton had difficulty finding a scientist to work with her on the project; there aren't many scientists studying laughter. But finally, she found Dunbar. Dunbar does research on laughter. He'll be in charge of analyzing the surveys. Both Dunbar and Stirling-Middleton are interested in the psychology behind the humor in cartoons. They also want the exhibit to be fun.
Visit the Laughter Lab soon. You'll help scientists and have a laugh!

The Laughter Lab
Arts & Entertainment
Why do we laugh at some jokes and not others? Visitors to The Cartoon Museum, in London, can help scientists find out! Laughter Lab: What's So Funny? is part exhibit, part scientific experiment. Researchers want to find out what it is that really makes humans laugh. And The Cartoon Museum is the perfect place to uncover the answers.
The wide selection of cartoons in the Laughter Lab exhibit were chosen from the museum's more than 6,000 pieces of artwork. Some of the cartoons are drawn in black and white; others are in color. In one black and white cartoon, an ant tells the ant next to it, "It's too quiet." Meanwhile, a huge anteater is silently floating in the air, sneaking up behind them. In another cartoon, a group of newborn babies look surprised to see a dog among them.
As visitors laugh their way around the exhibit, they'll see the pictures arranged in numbered pairs. Each cartoon in the pair is marked "A" or "B."  From each pair, visitors choose the cartoon they think is funnier. They record their reactions on a survey provided by the museum. When the Laughter Lab ends, after about six months, the results of the survey will be analyzed, and published by University of Oxford psychologist Robin Dunbar.
Dunbar, who helped create the exhibit, says that laughter is important for humans' everyday social lives. Dunbar has already done research on what makes comedians' jokes funny. One of his findings is that jokes are funnier when they have only two characters and aren't too complex; Dunbar wonders if the Laughter Lab's experiment will show similar results.
Dunbar worked on the Laughter Lab together with The Cartoon Museum curator Emma Stirling-Middleton. It was actually Stirling-Middleton's idea to create the exhibit. "I thought... it would be really nice to do an exhibition looking at laughter," she says.
At first, Stirling-Middleton had difficulty finding scientists to work with her on the project, as there aren't many scientists studying laughter. But luckily, she eventually found Dunbar. Stirling-Middleton is interested in the psychology behind the humor in cartoons, but she says that for her, the exhibit is mostly about having fun.





Each year, millions of tourists flock to Italy to view Renaissance masterpieces, such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper and Michelangelo's David. Through the centuries, these and other priceless pieces of art have become covered in layers of dirt and grime. To clean them, art restorers have developed different techniques, using various chemicals and even lasers. Recently, however, some of Michelangelo's 16th-century marble sculptures were cleaned in a different way - using bacteria!
Bacteria are very small living things that you can only see under a microscope. Using bacteria to clean the surface of stonework and artwork is called "biocleaning." In the last two decades, research has shown that biocleaning has advantages over traditional cleaning methods. It's more eco-friendly, for example, as using bacteria is a more natural process. And chemicals can actually harm the artwork while cleaning it.
In the biocleaning process, a gel containing the bacteria is applied to the surface. The gel stays on anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks, while the bacteria eat the dirt. Then, the gel is peeled back, and the surface is wiped off. Finally, the artwork is tested to ensure that no bacteria were left behind. "It's better for our health, for the environment, and the works of art," says art restorer Daniela Manna, about biocleaning.
Manna was part of an all-woman team of scientists, restorers, and historians who worked on the Michelangelo sculptures in the Medici Chapel, in Florence. In the lab, the biologists tested almost 1,000 strains to find the right bacteria to clean the marble - one that would eat the grime, but not the stone itself.
People often associate bacteria with negative things, such as illness. But Silvia Borghini, conservator at the National Roman Museum, in Rome, doesn't think bacteria deserve their bad reputation. "More than 95 percent of bacteria are not harmful to humans," says Borghini. Borghini recently used a strain of bacteria to clean a block of marble from a 4th-century Roman bridge. The marble sits in the garden of the museum.
Artifacts need to be protected from the ravages of time. Biocleaning is one interesting way to clean and restore important pieces of cultural heritage. It shows what is possible when we harness the power of the natural world.

Bacteria to the Rescue!
Arts & Entertainment
Have you ever seen Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper or Michelangelo's David? These are beautiful pieces of art from the Renaissance. To keep old artwork beautiful, art restorers need to take care of them.  One job of an art restorer is to clean the artwork. To do this, they often use chemicals or lasers. Recently, however, some art restorers have been using an unusual cleaning material - bacteria! Bacteria are very small living things that you can only see under a microscope.
Using bacteria to clean art is called "biocleaning." Unlike chemicals, bacteria don't damage artwork. Bacteria are also more eco-friendly than chemicals. "It's better for our health, for the environment, and the works of art," says art restorer Daniela Manna about biocleaning.
To begin cleaning, art restorers put a gel containing the bacteria onto the artwork. They leave the gel on for anywhere between a few hours and a few weeks. Meanwhile, the bacteria eat the dirt. Finally, the gel is wiped away.
Manna was part of an all-woman team that cleaned some of Michelangelo's 16th-century marble sculptures in Florence, Italy. They tested almost 1,000 strains to find the right bacteria - one that would eat the dirt, but not the stone itself. Bacteria were also recently used to clean part of a 4th-century Roman bridge. The large piece of marble from the bridge sits in the garden of the National Roman Museum, in Rome.
Renaissance paintings and sculptures are important cultural artifacts. They should be protected for the future. With bacteria, restorers have another tool to use in their fight against time.

Bacteria to the Rescue!
Arts & Entertainment
Did you ever see the art of Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo? Their art is from the Renaissance. The art is very old. Someone needs to clean the art, to keep it beautiful. This is the job of an art restorer.
Sometimes art restorers clean art with lasers. Sometimes they use chemicals. But chemicals can harm the artwork. And chemicals aren't good for the environment. Now, there is a natural way to clean art - with bacteria!
Bacteria are tiny living things. The restorers put bacteria on the art. The bacteria eat all the dirt.
Daniela Manna is an art restorer. Manna used bacteria to clean 16th-century sculptures. Scientists tested almost 1,000 kinds of bacteria for Manna. They finally found the right bacteria for Manna's project. The bacteria ate the dirt, but didn't harm the sculptures.
Some people think bacteria are bad. But restorers like Manna say bacteria are helpful. She says that cleaning with bacteria is "better for our health, for the environment, and the works of art."





What will happen in the future? Find out at the Smithsonian Institution, in the USA! The museum has a new exhibition called Futures. The exhibition teaches visitors about the future and the past.
Futures has four themes. One theme is Futures Past. Here, you can see a telephone that Alexander Graham Bell invented in 1876. You can also see a Bakelizer - one of the first machines that made plastic.
The Futures that Work section is about the environment. Visitors can try a special washing machine. It's next to a small garden. The machine washes clothes. Then, it pours the water into the garden so the plants grow.
Futures that Unite is about people working together. In one activity, you play a computer game. In the game, you plan a neighborhood. For example, you may put a park in your neighborhood.
Futures that Inspire has very new inventions. There is meat that grows like a plant. There is a taxi that can drive by itself, and fly!
Futures shows us that many things are possible.

Welcome to the Future(s)!

The Smithsonian Institution, site of the first national museum in the USA, recently had its 175th anniversary. To celebrate, they opened a new exhibition called Futures. Futures has nearly 150 items on display that connect the past to the future. There's artwork and historic objects. Visitors can also see some of the world's newest inventions.
The exhibition is taking place in the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building (AIB). AIB, one of the Smithsonian's oldest buildings, has four separate wings. For Futures, each wing of the AIB has its own theme.
In the Futures Past wing, visitors can see an early prototype of the first telephone, from 1876, made by Alexander Graham Bell. Another historic invention is the Bakelizer machine, one of the first machines to make plastic.
Futures that Work focuses on the environment. One exhibit is an eco-friendly coin-operated washing machine. Used water goes from the machine into a small garden right next to it, helping the plants grow. Visitors can try out the machine with their own coins and laundry!
The Futures that Unite wing focuses on ways we connect with each other. In one activity, visitors use special computer software to design their own neighborhoods. They can add parks to their neighborhood, for example.
The section that feels the most like science-fiction is Futures that Inspire. There, visitors see new kinds of food products, such as meat grown like mushrooms, and an insect-based snack food. There's also the Bell Nexus, a self-driving taxi that can fly!
No one can know what tomorrow will bring, but at Futures visitors can explore the possibilities.

Besides inventions, there are also interactive displays, historic artifacts, and artwork. Futures includes objects and displays the Smithsonian hopes will inspire visitors to think about the kind of future they want to live in.
Visiting Futures feels like attending a World's Fair from the 18th or 19th century. Back then, these fairs were the only place for the public to see the world's latest technologies and scientific developments. Futures is part of the Smithsonian's 175th anniversary celebration.
The exhibition is located in the museum's Arts and Industries Building (AIB). The AIB opened in 1881 and was the site of the first national museum in the USA. The AIB has four separate wings - each with its own theme. In the Futures Past wing, there are displays of historical innovations and ideas. You can see Alexander Graham Bell's experimental telephone from 1876, and the Bakelizer, from 1909 - one of the first machines to make plastic.
The Futures that Work section looks at ideas related to labor and helping the environment. One of the highlights is an eco-friendly, coin-operated washing machine. The machine's wastewater is used to grow a garden of plants in the tank next to it. Visitors can bring their own coins and laundry to test it out!
The Futures that Unite wing focuses on ways for people to connect with each other. This wing includes interactive touch-screen displays where visitors play a game called "Future Communities." Special computer software helps them generate their ideal neighborhood.
The section that feels the most like science-fiction is Futures that Inspire. Visitors can see new kinds of food products, such as meat grown like mushrooms, and an insect-based snack food. There's also a model of a city built on the ocean, and the Bell Nexus, a self-driving taxi that can fly!
 
No one can know what tomorrow will bring, but at Futures visitors can explore the possibilities. Monica Montgomery, a Smithsonian curator, says, it's "... 100% the most fun you can have in a museum."
 




A Movie That's Out of this World!
Arts & Entertainment
Russian actress Yulia Peresild has appeared in many movies, but none were as thrilling to make as her latest movie, The Challenge. In The Challenge, Peresild plays a doctor who travels to the International Space Station (ISS) to treat one of the cosmonauts. But it isn't just the plot that makes this movie exciting; some scenes were actually filmed in space!
In 2020, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, held a competition to choose an actress to star in what would be the first feature-length drama filmed partially in space. Peresild won the competition, beating out thousands of other actresses for the role. Along with Peresild, Roscosmos sent Klim Shipenko, a well-known Russian director, and Anton Shkaplerov, an experienced cosmonaut, to film on the ISS.
Professional astronauts spend years getting ready for space. But for their brief 12-day period of filming, Peresild and Shipenko trained for just three months! It was a rigorous training program, however. Peresild and Shipenko took flights in zero gravity, learned how to use a parachute, and were trained in the basics of space survival. They also practiced for emergencies that could happen after they left Earth. In fact, as their spacecraft was arriving at the ISS dock, there was an emergency, and Shkaplerov had to briefly take over the controls!
Since Shipenko couldn't bring a whole film crew into space, he did a lot more than direct the film. Shipenko also handled the cameras, lighting, sound, and makeup. And Shkaplerov and other cosmonauts pitched in too, working as actors in the movie. Cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky played the role of the man whose life Peresild's character tries to save.
 
While other, shorter, movies have already been filmed on board the ISS, such as a documentary, The Challenge was the first feature-film filmed there. Roscosmos hopes the project will show how space travel is becoming available to a wider range of people, not just astronauts. In the future, there may be more entertainment filmed on the ISS. Are you ready to watch a reality TV show called Who Wants to Be an Astronaut?

Yulia Peresild is a well-known Russian actress. Her latest movie is called The Challenge. In the movie, Peresild plays a doctor who travels to the International Space Station (ISS) to help a cosmonaut. But there is something extra special about Peresild's new movie. The Challenge is the first feature film with scenes filmed in space!
Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, is in charge of the movie project. In 2020, Roscosmos held a competition to choose the star of The Challenge. Peresild won. Along with Peresild, Roscosmos sent director Klim Shipenko to film on the ISS, and Anton Shkaplerov, an experienced cosmonaut too.
While cosmonauts spend years getting ready for space travel, Peresild and Shipenko's training took only three months. But it was very difficult. Peresild and Shipenko took flights in zero gravity. They learned to use a parachute, and how to drink water and wash their hair in space. The pair also practiced what to do in case of emergency. And there was an actual emergency. Their spacecraft had a problem on the way to the ISS. Thankfully, Shkaplerov was able to finish flying the ship to the ISS safely.
Usually, it takes a lot of people to make a movie. But there isn't a lot of room on the ISS. So, in addition to directing, Shipenko had to use cameras, adjust the lights, and help with makeup. Shkaplerov and other cosmonauts helped out too - they appeared as actors in the movie!
 
In the future, other types of entertainment will be filmed on the ISS. Get ready for television shows, as well as other movies which are in the works. Three, two, one... blast off!

A painting of a girl letting go of (or reaching for) a red, heart-shaped balloon appeared under a London bridge in 2002. Who created this image? The world-famous British graffiti artist Banksy, who is known for his stenciled street art. His spray-painted, stenciled works have covered walls of buildings, trains, bridges, and other public surfaces around the world.
Banksy isn't his real name. Almost no one knows who Banksy really is, or what he looks like. Banksy hides his identity. Staying anonymous helps him do his work in secret, since spray painting on public surfaces is illegal. Staying anonymous also makes Banksy more mysterious.
We do know that Banksy used to call himself "Robin Banx" (sounds like "robbing banks"), but then shortened it to Banksy. Banksy started making street art in the 1990s, in Bristol, England, and moved to London around 1999. By 2001, Banksy's artwork was popping up across the UK.
Aside from street art, Banksy has created sculptures and paintings on canvas. Today, Banksy's street art is respected in much of the art world. In the early 2000s, Banksy's artwork sold for a few thousand dollars. Then, prices for his artwork began to soar. In 2019, his oil painting Devolved Parliament sold for $12.1 million dollars!
After Banksy's Girl With Balloon bridge artwork became famous, Banksy painted the same image on canvas. In 2018, the auction house Sotheby's put it up for sale. As soon as it was sold, for $1.4 million dollars, a shredder hidden inside the frame shredded most of the painting! This stunt actually made the painting more valuable. Today, that partially shredded painting might be worth as much as $2.8 million dollars!
Banksy has pulled other stunts too. In 2003, he started smuggling his own works into museums. In the Louvre in Paris, he left a painting of the Mona Lisa with a smiley face where her face should be. At the British Museum, he left a rock with an image of a caveman pushing a shopping cart. It took three days before anyone even noticed!
There are many theories about Banksy's true identity. But most of his fans don't even want to know it. They prefer wondering who he is, and where his artwork will pop up next!

Banksy isn't his real name. Almost no one knows who Banksy really is. Banksy hides his true identity. Spray painting on buildings without permission is illegal. Hiding his identity allows Banksy to work in secret. It also adds to his mystery.
We do know that Banksy started making street art in the 1990s, in Bristol, England. At first, he called himself "Robin Banx." Then he shortened it to "Banksy." By 2001, Banksy's artwork was showing up in public places across the UK.
Besides street art, Banksy has created sculptures and paintings on canvas. In one painting, Girl With Balloon, a girl lets go of a red, heart-shaped balloon. In 2018, this painting was sold at auction for $1.4 million dollars. However, as soon as it was sold, it started getting shredded. Banksy had hidden a shredder inside the picture frame! This stunt actually made the painting even more valuable. Today, that shredded painting might be worth as much as $2.8 million dollars.
Banksy has done other stunts too. He took a picture of the Mona Lisa and put a smiley face on the Mona Lisa's face. Then, he hung it in the Louvre Museum in Paris! He sneaked artwork into museums in New York and London too.
People have been trying to discover Banksy's true identity for years. But many fans don't even want to know. They only want to know where Banksy's artwork will show up next!

Serious chess players can compete for years trying to earn a "master" title, but Adewumi had been playing chess for only about three years when he won the title.
Adewumi, now 11, was born in Nigeria. In 2017, he and his family came as refugees to New York, USA. Having nowhere to go, they lived in a homeless shelter. Adewumi enrolled in elementary school, and that's when his chess journey began.
In school, a teacher taught Adewumi how to play chess. Adewumi really enjoyed the game and wanted to join the school chess club, but his family couldn't afford it. When the coaches learned about Adewumi's situation, they waived the club's $330 fee. Shawn Martinez, Adewumi's coach, says he saw the boy's potential right away. "He has an incredible memory and he's very interested in what he's learning."
Adewumi practiced chess for hours in the evenings at the shelter. He also began competing - and winning trophies. Then, less than a year after he learned to play, Adewumi beat 73 other players to win the New York State chess championship! Winning the championship would change the lives of Adewumi and his family forever. 
After the state championship, Adewumi's coaches set up an online campaign to raise money for his family. Then, there was an article about Adewumi in the New York Times. People all over the world heard his inspiring story. Eventually, the campaign raised more than $250,000 dollars! There was even one donor who decided to pay the family's rent for a year on a two-bedroom apartment. This allowed the chess champion and his family to finally move out of the homeless shelter.
Today, Adewumi practices every day after school for about 10 hours. He also studies books about famous chess masters, and plays chess online. When Adewumi loses, he takes it in stride, and learns from his mistakes. "I say to myself that I never lose, that I only learn."




Saori Fujimoto: Sign Language Artist

What do BTS, GOT7, and Blackpink have in common? They are all famous K-pop bands. K-pop (Korean popular music) has become a global sensation. People everywhere love the bands' catchy tunes, exciting videos, and perfectly synchronized dancing. The all-male BTS is currently one of the most successful bands on the planet. Their song Dynamite has been viewed over 1 billion times! Now, deaf and hard-of-hearing people can enjoy the music too, thanks to a Japanese woman named Saori Fujimoto. Fujimoto posts videos of herself interpreting K-pop songs in unique ways using sign language.
You see sign language interpreters in many places, such as on television news programs. They translate words to signs for deaf viewers. Although Fujimoto is a trained interpreter, that's not what she does with K-pop songs. Fujimoto considers herself a sign language artist who blends sign language and choreography in her videos. According to Fujimoto, it's about emotions. "A sign language interpreter focuses on delivering information, while a sign language artist moves people with content," explains Fujimoto.
If a hearing person watches one of Fujimoto's videos with the volume off, that person will still get a good sense of the song. Fujimoto's trendy and dynamic movements, coupled with actual Korean Sign Language (KSL) signs, bring the silent music to life. Her first video was of BTS's upbeat hit ON because of its message about not giving up, even when life is difficult. "The song was like my personal story," she says.
Fujimoto's KSL story began in high school, when she visited Korea for the first time. She fell in love with Korea, especially its pop culture. She visited again before the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and Paralympics, and was inspired by the games to learn KSL. She studied almost every day for two years to pass an extremely difficult exam, but she never gave up. When she passed the written exam, she became the first foreign person ever to do so.
Fujimoto says she will continue making videos as a sign language artist. "I believe my role is to promote deaf awareness in Korea and abroad," she says. Keep your eye on her video channel to see what she performs next!

What do BTS, GOT7, and Blackpink have in common? They are all famous K-pop bands (Korean popular music). People all over the world love K-pop. In fact, the video of BTS's song Dynamite has been watched over one billion times! Deaf people can't usually enjoy these music videos. But now, a Japanese woman named Saori Fujimoto is changing that. She makes videos that put sign language and dance together, and her videos bring the music to life. Fujimoto is a sign language artist.
You see sign language interpreters in places such as television news programs. They translate words to signs for deaf viewers. Fujimoto, however, does more than that. Using dynamic dance movements, together with Korean Sign Language (KSL) signs, Fujimoto can show the emotions in each song. Between her signs and dance movements, a deaf person can feel the song's meaning.
Fujimoto's journey to KSL began while she was in high school and went to Korea for the first time. She really fell in love with K-pop! She visited again before the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and Paralympics. After seeing KSL there, Fujimoto wanted to learn it. She started studying - but it wasn't easy. She had to study almost every day for two years. Finally, she took a very difficult written test - and became the first foreign person to pass!
In her first video, Fujimoto performed BTS's song ON. She felt it was like her own life story: don't give up, even when life is hard. Fujimoto says she will continue making videos to raise awareness about deaf people. Which K-pop song will this sign language artist perform next?

Do you know the band BTS? It's a famous K-pop - or Korean popular music - band. Millions of people around the world love K-pop. One of those people is Saori Fujimoto. Fujimoto has an interesting job. She translates the Korean language into Korean Sign Language (KSL).
Fujimoto knows deaf people can't hear K-pop. They can understand the words, not the music. Fujimoto wants to change that. She makes videos with sign language and dance together. Her videos bring the music to life for deaf people. Fujimoto is a sign language artist.
Fujimoto is from Japan. When she was in high school, she went to Korea for a visit. She fell in love with K-pop! In 2018, she visited Korea again. She saw KSL for the first time. She began learning KSL. She studied for two years. Then, she took a very hard test - and passed!
Fujimoto makes videos with things she loves - KSL and K-pop. She hopes deaf people will enjoy the words and the feelings of the music.





The Mauritshuis is an art museum in the Netherlands. It has an exhibition of old paintings. These paintings show life in the 1600s. There is something unusual about the exhibition. What is it? You look at the pictures and smell them at the same time!
There is a special machine next to some of the paintings. The machine releases a smell into the air near the painting. Some of the smells are very nice. Some of them are terrible!
One painting shows boats on the water in Amsterdam. There is a man watching the boats from a bridge. To most people, it looks very nice. But in the 1600s, the water was very dirty. It smelled awful! So the machine by the painting releases a very bad smell. Then, you understand something about life in Amsterdam in the 1600s.
The exhibition also has paintings with sweet smells, like spices and flowers. It's art you can enjoy with your eyes and your nose, too!

Smell the Art!
Arts & Entertainment
There's a new exhibition at the Mauritshuis art museum in The Hague, Netherlands. The paintings show you what life looked like in the 1600s, which isn't unusual. But at this exhibition, you'll also learn what life smelled like!
The museum's exhibition is called Smell the Art: Fleeting - Scents in Color. There are special dispensers in front of some of the artwork. Push a pedal on a dispenser, and scented air comes out. "If you smell and look at the painting at the same time, it very much enhances the experience," says Ariane van Suchtelen, the exhibition's curator.
 
The exhibition recreates real smells from the 1600s, so you experience what people felt when they first saw the paintings hundreds of years ago. For example, one picture shows an Amsterdam canal on a typical, busy day. You see small boats on the water and a man standing on a bridge. To our modern eyes, it looks very nice. But someone from the 1600s wouldn't agree. In those days, the canals were dirty and smelled terrible, so the air from the dispenser stinks!
There are sweet scents too. Enjoy the smells from a "pomander," a type of jewelry like a little ball with spices and flowers inside. In the 1600s, people believed bad smells made you sick. Rich people wore sweet-smelling pomanders to protect themselves from bad smells. The exhibition used recipes from history to recreate a pomander's scent - like the one in the painting, Portrait of Aletta Hanemans.
You mustn't touch the paintings at the exhibition. But at Scents in Color, you can enjoy the art with your eyes and your nose too!

A new exhibition at the Mauritshuis art museum in The Hague, Netherlands, has paintings by Vermeer, Rembrandt, and other Dutch masters. The paintings show you what life looked like in the 17th century, and that's not unusual. But you'll also learn what life smelled like!
The exhibit, called Smell the Art: Fleeting - Scents in Color, has special scent dispensers in front of some of the paintings. You push a pedal with your foot to release a puff of scented air. Then, some wonderful (and not so wonderful) surprises greet your nose! "If you smell and look at the painting at the same time, it very much enhances the experience," says Ariane van Suchtelen, the exhibit's curator.
 
The exhibition recreates the smells people would have experienced when the pictures were painted. For example, a Jan van der Heyden painting from around 1670 shows an Amsterdam canal on a typical, busy day. Small boats and white swans pass each other on the water while a man watches from a bridge. To our modern eyes, it is a pleasant scene. But someone from the 1670s would know: in the 17th century, the canals were used as sewers, and they smelled terrible! At the exhibition, you can experience the past by viewing the scene while smelling the scent of the canal as it used to be. According to one journalist, it smelled like "a dirty gym bag full of spoiled fish"!
The exhibition has sweet scents, too. Take your nose over to Willem van Mieris' painting, A Grocer's Shop, and breathe in the aroma of spices, such as cloves and nutmeg. Or enjoy the scent of rose and lavender from a "pomander" like the one seen in Portrait of Aletta Hanemans by Frans Hals. In the 1600s, wealthy people wore pomanders - ball-shaped jewelry with fragrant spices and flowers inside. They thought pomanders could protect them from foul scents, which they believed caused illness. The smells of the exhibition's pomanders were recreated from real historical recipes.
"We view and experience everything - not just art - with all of our senses," says van Suchtelen. Although you aren't allowed to touch the paintings, you can enjoy how the sights combine with unique smells in this delightful art exhibition.

The Unusual Sport of Zorbing
Sport
"Zorbing" is an unusual sport. When you go zorbing, you sit in a clear, plastic ball, called a "zorb". Then, you roll down a hill! Zorbs can go faster than 48 kilometers an hour!
The zorb is actually two balls. One ball is inside the other ball. You sit in the smaller ball. There is a space between the smaller ball and the larger ball. In this space there is air. This air acts like a cushion. When the ball rolls, you don't feel the ground. The air makes you bounce. It protects you.
Some riders wear a harness. The harness holds them in place as the ball rolls. Some riders don't wear a harness. When the ball rolls, they bounce all around inside the ball. Some people do "aquazorbing." There is water in the ball! And some people don't roll down a hill. They roll on a track, on flat land.
Zorbing started in New Zealand, in the 1990's. Today, you can go zorbing all over the world.
 

The Unusual Sport of Zorbing
Sport
Recently, film director Mark Vins rolled down a steep hill inside a gigantic plastic ball. Why? Vin wanted to experience the extreme sport of "zorbing."
First, a person gets inside a "zorb." A zorb is a clear inflatable ball around three meters in diameter. Next, the zorb rolls down a hill, reaching speeds of more than 48 kilometers per hour! When the zorb reaches the bottom, it slows down, and eventually stops.
The zorb is actually two balls - one inside the other. The rider sits in the smaller ball. The space between the two balls is filled with air. The air acts as a cushion to protect the rider. Riders can wear a harness that keeps them in place, or ride without a harness. Without a harness, riders can move around inside the ball. Some zorbs are big enough for just one person. Others hold up to three.
Zorbing began in the 1990's. Andrew Akers and Dwane van der Sluis developed the sport in New Zealand. It became popular quite quickly. Since then, zorbing has spread around the world. You can go zorbing in countries such as Thailand, Ireland, and Korea.
And today, there are different types of zorbing. Sometimes the zorb rolls on special metal tracks, instead of down a hill. In Florida, USA, you can watch a zorbing race on tracks. Two people, each inside their own zorb, try to be the first to reach the finish line. There's also "aqua zorbing," where the inner ball is filled with water. Riders can "swim" as they roll. It looks like they're in a washing machine! Where will this unusual sport roll to next?

The Unusual Sport of Zorbing
Sport
On a recent trip to New Zealand, film director Mark Vins did something unusual - he agreed to climb inside a giant ball and get pushed down a steep hill. While the ball sped quickly down the grassy hill, Vins was tossed around and upside down, screaming with delight. Vins was checking out the extreme sport of "zorbing."
In zorbing, a person sits inside a "zorb," a transparent inflatable plastic ball, typically around three meters in diameter. The zorb is rolled down a hill, sometimes reaching speeds of over 48 kilometers per hour! At the bottom of the hill, the zorb slows down, and stops. It's that simple.
The zorb is actually two balls - one inside the other. The rider sits in the inner ball. The space between the two balls is filled with air, which provides cushioning to protect the rider, or "zorbonaut." Zorbonauts can ride with a harness so that they stay in place, as gravity pulls the ball down the hill. Or they can ride without a harness and move freely around the zorb, like Vins. Some zorbs are big enough to hold one person, while others can hold up to three.
Zorbing was developed by New Zealanders Andrew Akers and Dwane van der Sluis in the 1990's, and it quickly took off as an extreme sport. By 2001, it was so popular that the word "zorbing" was included in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. Since the 90's, zorbing has spread around the world to countries such as Thailand, Ireland, and Korea.
There are also different types of zorbing, such as "aqua zorbing," where the inner ball is filled with water, so riders "swim" around as they roll. It's like being in a huge washing machine! For another kind of zorbing, you don't need a hill. Instead, the zorb rolls on special tracks made of metal or wood. Barriers on each side keep the zorb on the track. The company Fun Crew USA runs zorbing events in Florida, USA. In one event, two zorbonauts race each other on a track. Where will this unusual sport roll to next?




A Wild Ride

Suleiman Kangangi is a professional cyclist from Kenya, and one of the best road cyclists in the east African region, which includes Tanzania, and Uganda. But Kangangi has dreams of becoming a top cyclist at the international level too. To accomplish this, he needs to compete in international races, against people from all over the world - not just east Africa. It can be difficult, however, for Kangangi and other east African cyclists to travel to Europe, where most international road races are held. Paying for travel and accommodations is very expensive. But Kangangi and other east African cyclists are in luck. There's a new international bike race. And it provides high-level racing right on African soil! It's called the Migration Gravel Race (MGR).
The MGR is a gravel bike race. Unlike road cycling, where bikers ride on smooth pavement, gravel cyclists race off-road, traveling over rocky terrain. During the MGR, cyclists ride the rough roads of Kenya's beautiful Masai Mara National Park. In addition to cyclists from east African countries, the MGR has many of the world's top cyclists, from countries such as Italy, Switzerland, Australia, and the US.
Over four days, cyclists race through the park over a unique and challenging 650-kilometer course. Some sections of the course have gravel. Other sections have rocky, red dirt. As they ride, they can enjoy the park's stunning scenery filled with grass, trees, and rivers. Sometimes the cyclists race through rural villages. They can see wild animals, including zebras, giraffes, and monkeys. In fact, each day before racing begins, a helicopter checks the course for elephants and buffalo, making sure the course is clear for the race. After each day of racing, cyclists camp out in the park. Sometimes, they are in such remote spots they can hear hyenas crying at night.
In the most recent MGR, out of 100 cyclists, Kangangi came in fourth place. Since then, he has been invited to participate in other international gravel races. He's excited about what gravel racing and the MGR mean for future east African cyclists. "I think it will just open even more roads to the younger generation here," says Kangangi.

They eat and sleep in very remote parts of the park.
This past year's MGR had 100 riders. Kangangi came in fourth place. Since he did so well, he was invited to compete in other important, international gravel races. Kangangi is excited that the MGR is opening doors for east African cyclists.

Suleiman Kangangi is a cyclist. He is from Kenya. Kangangi wins many bike races in east Africa. But Kangangi wants to win international bike races too. For these races, Kangangi must travel to different countries. Traveling costs a lot of money, so Kangangi can't always go. But there is a new international bike race. And it's in Kenya! The race is called the Migration Gravel Race (MGR).
The MGR is a gravel bike race. The road isn't smooth. It has small rocks. It is hard to ride on rocks. In the MGR, some cyclists are from east Africa. Other cyclists are from other countries, like Italy, Switzerland, Australia, and the US. Many riders are top cyclists.
The MGR is a 650-kilometer race. It is a four-day race. Cyclists ride through Masai Mara National Park. They see elephants, zebras, giraffes, monkeys, and other wild animals. Each night, the cyclists camp outside. They sleep in tents. They eat together.
Kangangi did very well in the MGR. Because of the MGR, people invited him to more international races.





Brandon Barques likes to fish. He is an angler. To catch fish, anglers use a fishing rod. The rod has a long string, called a line. The line has a hook at the end, with food. The angler drops the line into the water and waits for a fish.
Big fish live in deep water. How do anglers get to deep water? They ride in boats. Brandon Barques doesn't use a boat. He uses a fishing drone!
A fishing drone is a flying robot with a camera. Barques connects the fishing line to the drone. Then, he flies the drone over the deep water. The drone takes a video of what it sees in the water. Barques watches this video on his cell phone. When Barques sees big fish, he makes the drone drop the line into the water. Now, Barques waits for a fish. Once, Barques caught a 54-kilogram fish!
Many anglers don't like fishing drones. They say drones are noisy. They say that fishing with drones is "cheating." But drone fishing is catching on!

Drones Go Fishing!
Sport
You probably know about the sport of fishing. An angler uses a fishing rod to drop a fishing line into the water. The end of the fishing line has a hook with bait. When a fish bites, the angler pulls the fish to shore. Anglers like to catch big fish, but most fish that live close to shore are small. To catch larger fish, anglers usually take a boat into deep water. But now there's another solution - fishing drones!
A fishing drone is a small flying vehicle with a camera. The angler attaches the end of the fishing line to the drone. Using remote control, the angler flies the drone over deep water. The drone takes a video of what it "sees" in the water below and sends the video to the angler's cell phone.
The angler watches the video. When they see fish they want to catch, they tell the drone to drop the line into the water. Now, they wait for a fish to bite. In the meantime, they fly the drone back to shore.
Angler Brandon Barques, from Hawaii, USA, had a hard time catching large fish. Then one day, using a drone, he caught a fish weighing 54 kilograms!
However, not all anglers like drone fishing. Many say that fishing with a drone is "cheating." Others complain about the noise. Drones can also hurt fish; many rare fish hide in deep water. If anglers find too many of them, these fish could disappear completely. Some countries, like the USA and South Africa, have rules about drone fishing, to protect the fish.
But like it or not, drone fishing is catching on!

Drones Go Fishing!
Sport
You probably know about the sport of fishing. An angler - someone who fishes for recreation - uses a fishing rod to drop a fishing line into the water. The end of the fishing line has a hook with bait. When a fish bites, the angler reels it in.
It isn't always easy to find big fish close to the beach, so anglers will often take a boat into deeper water. Brandon Barques has been fishing for many years. In the past, Barques searched for large fish by rowing his kayak off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. But the fish he caught weren't very big. Finally, one day, Barques caught a 54-kilogram fish! He did it with help from a fishing drone.
A fishing drone is a small flying vehicle with propellers and a camera. It's flown by an angler on shore, using remote control. To use a fishing drone, you connect the end of the fishing line from the fishing rod to the drone. The drone carries the line far over the water. As the drone flies, its camera streams video to your cell phone showing you what it "sees" in the waters below.
When you find a good area for fishing, you have the drone drop the line into the water. Now, the drone's job is done, and you return it to shore. And your job - waiting for a fish to bite and reeling it in - has just begun!
A fishing drone is helpful because it can carry your line farther out to sea than you can throw it. And with a drone, you don't need a boat.
However, not everyone approves of drone fishing. Many anglers think it's "cheating." Others say the noisy drones disturb the relaxing atmosphere. Also, fish species living in deeper water are easier to catch with drones. This could be bad for the survival of the species. Some countries, such as the USA and South Africa, have rules about drone fishing to protect the fish.
While fishing drones are mostly made to help anglers look for fish, some even carry small fish back to anglers. Perhaps future drones will be able to bring large fish back to shore. That could really change the sport!





You've probably seen lots of people riding around on bicycles. But have you ever seen someone riding a wooden bike? Wooden bikes have been popping up in cities around the world. People love the look!
Bikes made of wood aren't new. They've been around since the 1800's, but they weren't popular for long. Now, they're back in style.
Standard wooden bike frames start out as two matching pieces of wood. First, the insides of the pieces are carved out. Next, the two sides are bonded together down the middle, using strong glue. Then, the rest of the bike parts, such as the gears, wheels and handlebars - made from metal or rubber - are added.
In the past, wooden bikes were made by hand, and you can still find new handmade wooden bikes. But using modern technology, manufacturers can produce wooden bikes in larger quantities than in the past.
Many people assume that wooden bikes are less safe or durable than metal or carbon bikes. However, wooden bike creators disagree. They say wooden bikes are tested to make sure they can take a lot of pressure. They say they're just as strong as metal bikes - and that some are even stronger. Many people think wooden bikes will get damaged by water, but they're waterproofed, so you can ride them in all kinds of weather. One of the biggest advantages of wooden bikes is that the wood absorbs vibrations, so they give a smoother ride than traditional bikes.
Wooden bikes are considered a luxury item. You can buy a traditional metal bike for daily use for less than a thousand dollars. But prices at Connor Wood Bicycles start at around 3,500 dollars. However, wooden bikes need repairs less often than metal bikes, so riders save money that way.
Chris Connor, owner of Connor Wood Bicycles, is proud of the craftsmanship of his custom-made bikes. "People like having something unique, something different," he says. Jan Gunneweg and Piet Brandjes, founders of Bough Bikes, say wooden bikes combine a love of the outdoors and of natural products. "If you design from nature," they say, "you will always create something that people feel comfortable with."

Bikes made of wood aren't new. They've been around since the 1800's, but they weren't popular for long. Now, they're back in style.
In the past, wooden bikes were made by hand. It took a long time to make them. Today manufacturers can use modern technology to make wooden bikes more quickly. Most wooden bike frames start out as two pieces of wood. First, the wood is shaped into a frame. Next, the two sides are glued together down the middle. Finally, the gears, wheels, handlebars, and other bike parts are added. These parts are usually made of metal or rubber.
Some people think that wooden bikes are less safe than metal bikes. They are afraid wooden bikes aren't as strong. But wooden bike manufacturers say their bikes are stronger than metal bikes. They test the bikes to make sure they can survive a lot of wear and tear. And riding a wooden bike, you don't feel many bumps on the road.
Wooden bikes are more expensive than your typical bike. On the other hand, wooden bike makers say their bikes almost never need to be fixed. One wooden bike manufacturer, Chris Connor, says customers don't mind paying high prices for something extra-special and "different."
Wooden bikes combine a love of the outdoors and a love of natural products. As another wooden bike maker says, "If you design from nature, you will always create something that people feel comfortable with."

When you ride a wooden bike, you don't feel many bumps on the road. With other bikes, you feel more bumps. Wooden bikes cost more than other bikes. But wooden bikes don't break often. Metal bikes and wooden bikes are both strong. People who make wooden bikes test their bikes. They make sure the wood doesn't break. 
You can buy wooden bikes from special bike makers. To make a bike, they first find a nice piece of wood. Next, they cut out two pieces for the frame (the main part of the bike). Then, they put the two pieces together with glue. Next, the bike maker connects the handlebars, seat and other bike parts. Usually, these parts are metal or rubber.
Chris Connor makes wooden bicycles. He says people like his bikes because they are "extra-special and different."




What is Pickleball?
Sport
Do you like tennis or Ping-Pong? Then you may like pickleball! In these games, you hit a ball over a net. In pickleball, you hit a plastic ball. The ball is light. The ball has lots of holes. You hit the ball with a paddle. The pickleball paddle is like a Ping-Pong paddle. But the pickleball paddle is bigger.
Pickleball is easy to learn. Many sport centers have pickleball classes. You can play pickleball with two or four players. Many people like playing pickleball outside. But you can play indoors too. Some shopping malls have pickleball courts. Most pickleball players are older than 65. But young people are also starting to play.
Three friends invented pickleball. They invented the game in 1965, in Washington, USA. The friends made the game for their families to play. Then, other people started playing the sport too. Today, pickleball is very popular. People in more than 70 countries play the game. People play pickleball in Spain, India, and Japan. Maybe one day, pickleball will be in the Olympics!

What is Pickleball?
Sport
Have you ever played the sport of pickleball? Pickleball is a combination of a few different sports, including tennis and Ping-Pong (table tennis).
The sport was invented by three friends, Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. They came up with the idea one summer. They were vacationing together with their families in Washington, USA, and their children were looking for something fun to do. The men took whatever sports equipment they could find, made up some rules, and that was the start of pickleball!
To play pickleball, you need paddles, a ball, and a net. As in tennis and Ping-Pong, players hit the ball back and forth over the net. They try to keep their opponent from hitting it back.
The pickleball net is like a tennis net, but a bit shorter. The paddles are like Ping-Pong paddles, but larger. Pickleballs are hollow plastic balls with holes, about the size of a tennis balls. But they don't bounce as high. Like tennis and Ping-Pong, pickleball can be played by two or four players.
Pickleball is one of the fastest-growing sports in the USA. There are tens of thousands of pickleball courts around the country. You can play indoors or outdoors. You can even play in shopping malls! Pickleball is being taught in sport centers and retirement communities. In fact, most pickleball players are over the age of 65. But today, more and more young people are starting to play.
The sport is also being played outside the US. Seventy countries, including Spain, India, and Japan have joined the International Federation of Pickleball. Maybe one day pickleball will be in the Olympics!

Have you ever played pickleball? Many people around the world enjoy playing the sport with the funny name.
Pickleball was created in the summer of 1965, in Washington, USA, by three friends, Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. The men and their families were on vacation together. They invented the sport to keep their children busy, using whatever sports equipment they had on hand. The sport combined elements of tennis, Ping-Pong (table tennis) and badminton. The friends made the game easy to learn, and suitable for all ages and skill levels, so all family members could play.
Eventually, other people started playing pickleball too. A decade after the sport was invented, the first official pickleball tournament was held. By 1990, pickleball was being played in all 50 US states.
Pickleball is played using paddles (about twice the size of Ping-Pong paddles), a ball, and a net. As in tennis, badminton and Ping-Pong, players hit the ball over a net, trying to prevent their opponents from hitting it back. A pickleball net is somewhat shorter than a tennis net. The balls are hollow, plastic, and have holes. They are about the size of a tennis ball, but don't bounce as high.
Most pickleball games are played in "doubles," with two players on each team. But they can also be played in "singles," with two players competing against each other. Pickleball can be played on both indoor and outdoor courts. And the game can be noisy. Pickleball players and spectators often get quite loud, and they play music during games.
Pickleball is being taught in community centers, sport centers, and retirement communities around the US. In fact, most serious pickleball players are over the age of 65. "It helps you with your flexibility, your agility," says Nancy Huddleston, a retiree and pickleball enthusiast. But many young people are starting to play pickleball too. Shopping malls are even installing pickleball courts!
Today, you can find pickleball courts at about 10,000 locations in the USA. Pickleball recently made headlines as the fastest-growing sport in the country. And it's growing worldwide too. So far, 70 countries including Spain, India, and Japan, have joined the International Federation of Pickleball. Maybe one day pickleball will make it into the Olympics!





Athlete Janja Garnbret, from Slovenia, scales an indoor wall. Attached to the wall are pieces of plastic of different shapes and sizes, called "holds." Garnbret moves up the wall by grabbing onto, and stepping on, the holds. By the end of her climb, she's hanging by her fingertips almost 15 meters in the air! Garnbret is a gold medal winner in one of the newest Olympic sports: indoor rock climbing.
Since becoming an Olympic sport, many people have started indoor rock climbing. The company El Cap, which owns indoor climbing gyms in the USA, says that 10% more people started visiting its gyms at the start of the Olympics. Indoor rock climbing is also one of the fastest growing sports in the UK, according to the Association of British Climbing Walls.
Climbing gyms offer three styles of climbing - top rope, lead, and bouldering. Top rope climbers and lead climbers wear a harness around their legs and waist. In top rope, one end of the rope is tied to the top of the wall (and goes through the harness). The other end is attached to the climber's partner, who assists the climber from below.
In lead climbing, the rope isn't connected to the top of the wall. Instead, climbers keep the rope with them on their harness. They attach the rope to clips on the wall as they climb. They also have a partner to assist them.
For the last type of climbing, bouldering, a smaller wall is used. Bouldering doesn't involve ropes, harnesses, or partners. Climbers are free to use more creative, athletic movements.
In all styles of climbing, holds are arranged in unique ways to create different climbing "routes." When you climb a route, you use only the holds of one color. To help keep their feet on the holds, climbers wear special, tight shoes with sticky, rubber soles. They also wear a bag filled with powdered chalk, which they use to dry their sweaty hands.
Indoor rock climbing strengthens muscles, improves flexibility and coordination, and keeps the heart and brain healthy. Many climbers enjoy the social aspect of indoor climbing. "The climbing community is notoriously friendly, welcoming, and supportive," says long-time climber Andrew Chen.
Are you ready to join this climbing trend?

Climbing to the Top
Sport
Indoor rock climbing is a very popular sport. Around one million people go indoor rock climbing in the UK each year. Recently, indoor rock climbing became an Olympic sport. That made it even more popular around the world.
 
Rock climbing gyms have walls of different heights. Colorful plastic pieces, called "holds," stick out all over the walls. Climbers use the holds to grab onto, to pull themselves up the wall. The holds are different shapes and sizes. To help their feet stay on the holds, climbers wear special, tight shoes. They also put chalk on their hands to keep them dry, so they can grip the holds better.
Indoor climbing gyms offer three kinds of climbing � top rope, lead, and bouldering. Top rope and lead climbers wear a harness around their legs and waist. In top rope, one end of the rope is tied to the top of the wall (and goes through the harness). The other end is attached to the climber's partner, who helps the climber from below.
In lead climbing, the rope isn't connected to the top of the wall. Instead, the climber keeps the rope with them on their harness. They attach the rope to clips on the wall as they climb. They also have a partner to assist them.
The third climbing activity is bouldering. When bouldering, climbers don't use ropes and they don't need a partner. Bouldering walls aren't very high, and climbers can fall safely onto soft mats below.
Indoor rock climbing strengthens your muscles and keeps your brain healthy. It's also a good way to make new friends. Are you ready to climb?

Climbing to the Top
Sport
Many people enjoy rock climbing. It's a fun and healthy sport. But some people like to climb indoors. They go to climbing gyms.
The gyms have special walls to climb. Each wall is a different height. There are pieces of plastic all over the walls. These pieces are many colors, shapes, and sizes. Climbers call these plastic pieces "holds." Climbers put their hands and feet on the holds. They use the holds to climb up the wall. Climbers wear special climbing shoes. They put chalk on their hands too. The chalk makes it easier to grab the holds.
You can do three kinds of climbing at a climbing gym - top rope, lead, and bouldering.
Climbers who do top rope or lead work with a partner. They also use ropes and harnesses. This equipment keeps the climbers safe.
But a boulderer doesn't need equipment or a partner. Bouldering walls are low. When a boulderer falls, it is a short fall. The boulderer also falls on a soft mat.

There is a famous boat race in Ohio. People race boats made from cardboard! The name of the race is the International Cardboard Boat Regatta.
Before the race, people make boats with cardboard and tape. Then, they paint their boats. The paint makes the boats look nice. It also keeps water out of the boats.
Some people make their boats look like bees, horses, or other objects. It can take 500 hours to build boats like these! The cardboard boats are very big. People sit in their boats and hold a paddle. They use the paddle to move through the water. Some people race alone. Other people race in teams.
You can win prizes at the regatta. One prize is for the fastest boat. Another is for the best boat name. There are other prizes too.
"Team Lemon" is a group of four men. They race in the regatta every year. They also made a Cardboard Boat Museum. The museum has 30 amazing cardboard boats!

Sport
Have you ever seen a boat shaped like a teacup, a bee, or a horse?  These are actual boats! They raced in a competition. What's even more surprising? They were all made of cardboard! Each August, thousands of people come to the International Cardboard Boat Regatta, in New Richmond, Ohio, USA.
To compete in the race, you must make a boat out of cardboard, tape and house paint. The paint does more than add color; it makes the boat waterproof. The boat can be shaped and decorated in any way you want. Some boats are very complex. They take about 500 hours to build!
More than 70 people compete in the regatta each year. Some race alone. Others race in teams. Participants paddle their boats over 183 meters of the Ohio River. Winners receive trophies. Some of the trophies are for the fastest boat, the most durable boat, and the best boat name. There's even a "Titanic Award" for the boat that sinks in the most exciting way!
Tom Lemon and his team "Team Lemon" compete in the regatta every year. They used to build their boats in an old gas station. It became their workshop. One year, they found a creative cardboard boat being thrown away. They took the boat and hung it on the wall of their workshop. Soon, they added other boats. Now, their workshop is a museum - the Cardboard Boat Museum!
Today, the museum has more than 30 cardboard boats. There are canoe-shaped boats, a shoe-shaped boat, and a three-meter-long guitar boat. One boat looks like Batman's car! As Tom Lemon says, "It's just a lot of fun."

Two women paddle their bee-shaped boat quickly over the Ohio River, while the crowd cheers them on. A teacup-shaped boat starts to take on water in its saucer. And a man with a cowboy hat paddles his "horse" boat, whose tail waves in the wind. These are just a few of the cardboard boat creations that have competed in the International Cardboard Boat Regatta. This unique event takes place each August in New Richmond, Ohio - America's Cardboard Boat Racing Capital.
Each summer, thousands of people come to watch this people-powered cardboard boat race. Only boats made entirely from cardboard can compete. To build the basic structure, contestants may use only cardboard, tape and latex house paint (which, aside from adding color, makes the boats waterproof).
For the first regatta, in 1993, participants simply threw pieces of cardboard into the river, hopping on and seeing how far they could get before sinking. Over time, however, the boats became more and more sophisticated. Many of today's designs are very complex. Some can take 500 hours to build!
More than 70 participants (working individually or in teams) paddle their boats on a 183-meter river course. They compete for 27 trophies in a variety of categories, including fastest boat, most durable boat, and best boat name. And because in early races most boats sank, there's even a "Titanic Award" for the most spectacular sinking!
"Team Lemon" participates in the event every year. In 2007, this group of men started using a former gas station as their cardboard boat-building workshop. One year, they found an artistic cardboard boat headed for the trash after a race. They rescued it and displayed it on the wall of their workshop. Eventually, they added other boats to their workshop - and the world's first and only Cardboard Boat Museum was born! Today, more than 30 cardboard boats cover the walls, ceiling and floor!
The museum's collection is varied. There are canoe-shaped boats, a shoe-shaped boat, and a three-meter-long guitar boat. There's even a "Batboat," which looks like the car of comic book hero Batman.
"It's just a lot of fun," says Tom Lemon, of Team Lemon. He adds that for regatta winners there's no money in it. "It's just bragging rights for a year."





You've probably heard of the Olympic Games, but have you heard of the annual World Eskimo-Indian Olympics (WEIO)? At the WEIO, in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA, members of indigenous groups participate in a range of contests that have been part of their cultures for generations.
For centuries, indigenous villages held competitions for young men to prove they could hunt and survive in their harsh, frozen environments. Over time, residents worried that the traditional contests would be forgotten, so in 1961, they started the WEIO. Today, about 400 indigenous male and female athletes from North America, Russia, Norway, and Greenland compete in the four-day summer event.
Amber Applebee, a member of the indigenous Athabaskan group, who competes in the games, says the WEIO feels "like a big family reunion." But while WEIO contests are friendly, and competitors may offer each other advice, the athletes take competition seriously, showcasing their strength, agility and ability to deal with pain.
There are about 20 different events at the WEIO. One of the most popular contests is the "two-foot high kick." A competitor jumps into the air and kicks a ball hanging from a piece of string, with both feet. They must land with both feet on the ground, without falling. After each successful kick, the ball is raised higher. The competitor who kicks the ball at the highest height wins. Traditionally, indigenous people used kicks to communicate over long distances during whale-hunting season.
In the "Eskimo stick pull," two contestants sit face-to-face on the ground with their knees bent, holding onto a stick between them. The contestants try to pull the stick away from their opponent or pull their opponent up off the ground. This strength test requires similar skills needed to pull a seal through a hole in the ice.
In the "blanket toss," one contestant stands in the middle of a large animal-skin blanket. Dozens of people hold the edges of the blanket and throw the contestant high into the air. The contestant must remain balanced, and land on their feet!
The WEIO is both a sporting event and celebration of indigenous cultures. "I want my children to know who we are and what our people did," says Applebee, "and the WEIO is the best way to do that."

You've probably heard of the Olympics. But have you heard of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics (WEIO)? The WEIO is a four-day indigenous sporting event. Each summer, members of indigenous groups from North America, Russia, Norway, and Greenland gather in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. There, about 400 men and women compete in traditional sports and games.
Many years ago, indigenous men competed in contests to show their strength and survival skills. Indigenous people began to worry that these contests would be forgotten. So, in 1961, they started the WEIO.
One competition is the "Eskimo stick pull." To begin, two athletes sit on the ground facing each other, holding onto a stick between them. The first one to pull the stick away from their opponent wins. This contest tests strength; indigenous hunters needed strength to pull a seal through a hole in the ice.
Another competition is the "two-foot high kick." Athletes jump up and kick a ball hanging from a piece of string using both feet. They must land with both feet on the ground. Each time they succeed, the ball is raised higher. Whoever kicks the ball at the highest height wins.
In the "blanket toss" one contestant stands in the middle of a large animal-skin blanket. Many people hold onto the blanket and throw the contestant high into the air. The contestant must stay upright, on their feet.
The WEIO is a sporting event and celebration of cultures. Athlete Amber Applebee is a member of the indigenous Athabaskan group. "I want my children to know who we are and what our people did," she says. "The WEIO is the best way to do that."

Did you enjoy jump roping as a child? Many people used to think jump roping was just for kids. But the pandemic changed that. Millions of people stayed home during lockdowns, and gyms everywhere closed. It was the perfect time for adults to try the sport of jump roping.
Jump roping became a competitive sport in the 20th century, but there are lots of reasons it became so popular during the pandemic. First, you can do it alone. And it doesn't need very much space, so it's a great activity to do indoors. Also, you don't need any expensive equipment. A basic jump rope costs less than $20. Finally, jump ropes are portable. You can take your rope with you and exercise anywhere you want.
Lauren Flymen, from Saint Albans, England, began jumping after watching jump rope videos on social media at the start of the pandemic. She improved her jumping, and even learned to do tricks. Flymen began posting her own videos, and today, she has more than 300,000 followers! "People think jump roping looks easy but it's not," says Flymen.
Jump roping - like most sports - is good for your health too. A 2013 study found that 10 minutes of jump roping is as good for you as 30 minutes of running. Additionally, research shows jump roping makes your heart stronger. It also lowers your blood pressure, and it improves coordination and balance. Flymen believes one of the biggest benefits has been for her mental health. "You actually don't think about all your troubles and all your stresses in life," says Flymen.

Walk past any schoolyard and you'll probably see kids playing jump rope. Children love doing this fun activity alone, in pairs, or in groups. You may think jump roping is just for kids, but the pandemic changed that. As gyms closed worldwide and lockdowns kept millions of people at home, many adults found jump roping to be the perfect sport.
There are lots of reasons jump roping (or as the British call it, skipping) became so popular during the pandemic. You can do it alone, it doesn't require too much skill to get started, and you don't have to buy a lot of expensive equipment. A basic jump rope costs less than $20. Also, jump roping requires very little space, so it's a great activity for those stuck indoors. And it's portable, so you can exercise anywhere.
Just ask Lauren Flymen of Saint Albans, England. At the beginning of the pandemic, Flymen was inspired by "jumpers" on social media. As she improved, Flymen learned tricks like the "mic release" where she lets the handle go, whips the rope around, and then catches it again - all while jumping! Flymen began posting her own videos, and she now has more than 300,000 followers!
Jump roping has been a competitive sport since the 20th century. Today, more than 60 countries are members of the International Jump Rope Union. The organization holds competitions where athletes do more than just jumping. There are freestyle events - where jumpers do amazing tricks with exotic names, such as the two-footed frog, full twist, cougar, and triple under. "People think jump roping looks easy, but it's not," says Flymen.
Besides tricks, there are other reasons to jump rope. It's good for you! According to a 2013 study from Arizona State University, 10 minutes of jump roping is as good for you as 30 minutes of running. Additionally, research shows it lowers your blood pressure and strengthens your heart. Jumpers also improve their coordination and balance. Flymen believes one of the biggest benefits has been for her mental health. "You actually don't think about all your troubles and all your stresses in life," says Flymen. Some jumpers even say it's like meditation!

The Exciting World of Teqball
Sport
It's the last moments of the match between Brazil and Hungary - and the clock is ticking. Brazil's coach looks worried. Can his team hold onto their lead? With only a few seconds left, player Natalia Guitler sends the ball flying with a powerful kick and... Brazil wins! The crowd is on its feet! Is this the end of a thrilling championship soccer match? No! It's... teqball.
Invented in 2012, the fast-paced sport of teqball combines elements of table tennis, soccer, and volleyball. The teqball table looks like a table tennis table, but the surface is curved and it's divided by a clear piece of plexiglass - not a net. Also, like table tennis, the exciting sport is played between two players as a singles game, or between four players as a doubles game. Teqball uses an actual soccer ball, and teqball players - called teqers - can use any part of their body to hit the ball, except their hands and arms. Just like volleyball, players get three hits before sending the ball back to their opponents.
One unique feature of teqball is that technique is more important than strength. That means women can compete as equals with men. In fact, according to the official rules of the game, teqball is played by two or four players, regardless of gender. In teqball, men and women often compete against each other and play on mixed gender teams. According to teqer Carolyn Greco, "Teqball isn't a contact sport, and being smaller or less strong than some of the men I play against is not as much of a factor."
Despite this, Greco and Nancy Avesyan started the world's first all-female teqball club called Bella Teq in California, USA. Greco and Avesyan hope their club will encourage more women to become teqball athletes, because at present, the sport is dominated by male players.
To date, there are teqball clubs in almost 100 countries around the world, and the sport is growing fast. Teqball has been recognized by the National Olympic Committees of Africa and Asia. "Our North Star right now is to be an Olympic sport by 2028," said Ajay Nwosu, president of the USA National Teqball Federation.

It's the last minute of an exciting match between Brazil and Hungary, and Brazil is leading. With only a few seconds left, a Brazilian player gives the ball a powerful kick and... Brazil wins! The crowd cheers! Is this the end of a championship soccer game? No! It's... teqball.
Teqball is a bit like table tennis, soccer, and volleyball. Players - called teqers - play on two sides of a table. The table, however, is curved and has a piece of clear plastic across it, not a net. Also, like table tennis, teqball is played between two players, or between four players. Both soccer and teqball use a soccer ball, and players can use any part of their body to hit the ball, except their hands and arms. And like volleyball, players get three hits before sending the ball back to their opponents.
In teqball, how you play is more important than how strong you are. According to teqer Carolyn Greco, "Being smaller or less strong than some of the men I play against is not as much of a factor." In fact, teqball rules allow men and women to compete against each other. They also allow mixed-gender teams. Although today most teqball players are men, Greco wants to change that. She and another teqer called Nancy Avesyan started Bella Teq, the world's first all-female teqball club. Greco hopes the club, which is in California, USA, will encourage more women to join the sport.
Teqball was invented in 2012, and this exciting, young sport already has clubs in almost 100 countries. What's next for teqball? Players hope it will become an Olympic sport by 2028!

Imagine a game with two players. There is a table between them. The players hit a ball across the table. Can you guess the sport? Here's a hint... No! It isn't table tennis.

The sport is teqball. It's a fast, exciting game. You can play teqball with teams of one or two players. A team can have men, or women, or both! According to the rules, it doesn't matter.
Today, most teqball players are men. But Carolyn Greco from California, USA, wants more women to play. That's why she started a teqball club only for women. It's called Bella Teq.
Teqball began in 2012. Today, the sport is very popular. There are teqball clubs in more than 100 countries! Teqball players are very excited about the new sport. They hope it will be in the Olympics in 2028.
 





It's summer, and Nawina Mufaya is swimming. But Mufaya is in Scotland. And summers in Scotland are cold. But Mufaya doesn't mind. She swims in an outdoor swimming pool in the cold weather. And she's not alone. Mufaya belongs to a club. It's an outdoor swimming club. Mufaya swims with other people in the club.
There are many outdoor swimming clubs. Some clubs don't swim in pools. They swim in lakes, rivers and oceans. Swimming in nature is called "wild swimming."
Scientists say that outdoor swimming helps people sleep better. The cold water keeps their skin healthy. The cold water also keeps their minds healthy.
The Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) is a special group. Their swimmers go on swimming adventures. They may go to the beautiful Blue Lagoon in Malta. They may swim down a river in Iceland. They may swim with seals in Devon, UK!
But outdoor swimming isn't new. The Brighton Swimming Club is an outdoor swimming club. And it is 160 years old!

It's typical summer weather in Greenock, Scotland - cloudy, windy, and cold (about 12� C ) - not what you'd normally call "swimming weather." Yet, a group of people are swimming in an outdoor pool. They're part of an outdoor swimming club called the Inverclyde Masters. "The only thing that would stop us swimming in the outdoor pool would be lightning," says club member Nawina Mufaya. The outdoor pool is a heated saltwater pool, open from May through September.
But for some outdoor swimmers, swimming in a pool isn't enough. They prefer "wild swimming" - swimming in natural bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes and oceans. Some wild swimmers want the challenge of swimming in colder, rougher water. Others just enjoy swimming in nature. 
The Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) was founded in 2006. It educates people about wild swimming. OSS members go on swimming adventures in beautiful places around the world. Some swim over sparkling white sand in Malta's Blue Lagoon. Others swim down freezing rivers in Iceland. One group, swimming off the coast of Devon, UK, were joined by local seals!
Outdoor swimming isn't some new trend. The UK has many swimming clubs. The oldest, Brighton Swimming Club, is 160 years old. Club member Adam Sage starts each day with a dip in the Atlantic Ocean. Member David Bailey commutes to work by swimming there!
Researchers say that outdoor swimming helps people sleep better. And the cold water keeps their skin healthy, Dr. Mark Harper is researching how outdoor swimming affects people with depression. He believes the cold water improves their mental health.
Today, more and more people are "diving" into the outdoor swimming experience!

"The only thing that would stop us swimming in the outdoor pool would be lightning," says Nawina Mufaya, a member of the club. Club members swim outside from May through September. Then, the outdoor pool closes.
For other outdoor swimmers, swimming in a pool is not enough. They swim in natural bodies of water, like lakes, rivers, and oceans. This is called "wild swimming." Wild swimmers may be drawn to the sport by their love of nature. Others seek the challenge of rougher conditions from waves and cold, choppy water.
Kate Rew founded the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS). Its goal is to educate people about swimming outside. Since 2006, the society has grown from 300 members to 100,000. The OSS also has a free, online crowdsourced swim map, showing wild swimming spots worldwide. Members of the OSS have had swimming adventures in beautiful places, such as the pristine waters of Malta's Blue Lagoon, or a nearly frozen river in Iceland. Sea swimmers in Devon, UK, were joined by local seals!
Outdoor swimming isn't some new trend. The Brighton Swimming Club (BSC), a UK swimming club that does outdoor swimming, is 160 years old. The BSC has enthusiastic members, such as Adam Sage, who starts each day with a dip in the Atlantic Ocean, and David Bailey, who "swimmutes" (commutes by swimming) two kilometers to his law office.
Experts say that outdoor swimming's health benefits include better sleep, and healthier skin from being in cold water. Dr. Mark Harper, from Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, is researching how swimming in cold water helps people with depression. Harper is optimistic about the results so far, saying open air swimming has "all the benefits of an effective treatment for mental health."
Whether it's "open air" swimming or "wild" swimming, more and more people across the globe are "diving" into this form of exercise!





Have you ever been to a trampoline park? These indoor spaces have wall-to-wall trampolines and other equipment. Today, with more than 1,500 trampoline parks across the globe, chances are you, or someone you know, have enjoyed jumping at one of these parks. But how did trampolines become so popular? Believe it or not, it all started at the circus!
George Nissen was an accomplished diver and gymnast from Iowa, USA, who tried unsuccessfully to get on the 1932 Olympic diving team. At 16, while he was watching high-wire acrobats at the circus, Nissen had a great idea. At the end of their act, the acrobats jumped down from the high wire, bouncing onto a safety net below. Nissen thought the acrobats could turn the bouncing into tumbling. He began working on a "tumbling device." Nissen tried using materials such as old tires, wood, and different types of metal for his device. Eventually, he used a large piece of strong cloth called "canvas" that was pulled tightly over a metal frame. The frame was in the shape of a rectangle, and the device folded up for easy transport. The trampoline was born!
The 1940s were an important time for the trampoline. Nissen co-founded the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline and Tumbling Company in 1942 to sell his invention. He also applied for a patent, which he received in 1945. During World War II, Nissen sold around 100 trampolines to the US military. Pilots would practice jumping very high, then spinning in the air. This helped them learn how to control their bodies, and orient themselves while flying. In later years, trampolines were used to train astronauts. As the training developed, Nissen created a game called Spaceball which was played on trampoline "courts."
As trampolines continued to be part of popular culture, they showed up all over the USA. They were so popular in the 1950s, that gas stations used them to attract customers. The 1960s brought the first trampoline parks. And Nissen's design has continued to evolve as new types, such as trampolines that float on water, have been developed.
In 2000, trampoline became an Olympic event. "That was always my goal and my dream," said Nissen. "The struggle and the journey - that's the Olympic spirit."

A trampoline park is a large, indoor space filled with trampolines. Today there are more than 1,500 trampoline parks all over the world. How did trampolines become popular? Well, it all started when a gymnast named George Nissen went to the circus!
As a young gymnast in Iowa, USA, Nissen enjoyed watching acrobats perform at the circus. At the end of the show, they would jump down onto a net. When he saw them bouncing on the net, Nissen was inspired. He thought there could be a way to turn bouncing into tumbling. So Nissen started making a "tumbling device" for gymnasts. At first, he tried using old tires and wood. Finally, he built a metal frame in the shape of a rectangle. A large piece of strong cloth called "canvas" was pulled tightly over the frame. The trampoline was born!
In 1942, Nissen started a company to sell his new trampolines. People were very excited about them. The US military bought around 100 trampolines to teach pilots about finding the right direction inside their airplanes. Later, trampolines were used to train astronauts for space travel. But trampolines also became popular with people who just wanted to have fun. By the 1960s, the first trampoline parks were built. And people made new kinds of trampolines, too. There is even a trampoline that floats on water!
In the year 2000, trampoline became an Olympic event for the first time. "That was always my goal and my dream," he said "The struggle and the journey - that's the Olympic spirit."

In the 1930s, George Nissen was a gymnast in Iowa, USA. One day, he went to the circus. He saw people "flying" high in the air. Then, they jumped down onto a net. They bounced up and down on the net. That gave Nissen an idea. He started to make an invention. People could jump and bounce on his invention. He called it a "trampoline."
In 1942, Nissen started a company to make trampolines. The US military bought 100 trampolines from Nissen. They used the trampolines to teach pilots about flying. Pilots jumped on a trampoline. It felt like flying in an airplane. Later, astronauts used trampolines too.
Trampolines weren't just for pilots and astronauts. People used trampolines to have fun. Trampolines became very popular. In the 1960s, people built the first trampoline parks. Today, there are more than 1,500 trampoline parks all over the world. Is there a trampoline park near you? Then go for a jump. It's a lot of fun!




Baseball or Pes�pallo?
Sport
You're watching a ball game. The batter hits the ball with a bat. The batter runs to the bases. People stand up and cheer. Is this a baseball game? No. It's a pes�pallo game! Pes�pallo is Finland's national sport.
Lauri "Tahko" Pihkala invented pes�pallo in 1922. Pihkala was from Finland. He wanted Finland to have its own game. Pihkala liked American baseball. So he made pes�pallo like baseball in some ways.
How are baseball and pes�pallo alike? In both games, two teams play against each other. Each team has nine players. The field has four bases. "Batters" hit a ball and run to the bases. "Fielders" try to get the batters "out."
But pes�pallo is also different from baseball. A pes�pallo field is long and narrow. Pes�pallo pitchers stand very close to the batter. Then, they throw the ball straight up. In pes�pallo, players run to the bases in a zigzag path. Pes�pallo is a faster game than baseball.
Today, people in India, Germany and Australia also play pes�pallo. They like this exciting game.

The batter swings the bat. The bat hits the ball up toward the sky. The batter runs to the bases and scores. The crowd stands up, clapping and shouting. Are they at a baseball game? No. They're at a pes�pallo game! Pes�pallo is Finland's national sport. It was inspired by American baseball.
Lauri "Tahko" Pihkala invented pes�pallo in 1922. As an athlete and coach in Finland, Pihkala knew that sports help people stay healthy. After Finland won its independence in 1917, Pihkala thought a new sport would be good for the country. Pihkala was inspired by an American baseball game he saw in 1907, so he began developing his own ball game.
Like American baseball, pes�pallo has two teams of nine players. The playing field has four bases. "Batters" hit the ball with a bat, then run to the bases to try and score "runs" (points). There are also "fielders," who try to get the ball, and get the batter "out".
But pes�pallo and baseball are also very different. For example, a baseball field has a diamond shape. A pes�pallo field has a long, narrow shape. A baseball pitcher throws the ball from the center of the field. In Pes�pallo, the pitcher stands right in front of the batter and throws the ball straight up over the batter's head. In baseball, players run counterclockwise around the field. In pes�pallo, players run in a zigzag pattern. Pes�pallo is a quicker game than baseball, and many people find it more exciting.
Pes�pallo is spreading around the world. Pes�pallo games are being played in India, Germany and Australia. Score one for pes�pallo!

The batter swings the bat. The bat connects with the ball, sending it flying high. The batter runs to the bases and scores. The crowd goes wild. They stand up and cheer. Are the fans at a baseball game? No. They're at a pes�pallo game! Pes�pallo is a ball game that's almost 100 years old. It's also the national sport of Finland.
Pes�pallo was invented in 1922 by Lauri "Tahko" Pihkala. Pihkala was an Olympic athlete, coach, and physical education instructor in Finland. After World War I, Finland became an independent country. Pihkala thought that sports would help his young country develop a national identity, while also promoting healthy living. Pihkala visited the USA several times, and became interested in American baseball on a trip in 1907. Back in Finland, Pihkala began developing his own version of baseball, with modified rules and elements of the Finnish game "king ball." Pes�pallo became popular in schools and in the military.
Like in American baseball, pes�pallo has two teams of nine players. The teams compete on a field with four bases. There are "batters," who hit balls with a bat, and then touch the bases in order to score "runs" (points). There are "fielders" in the playing field, who try to get the ball, and get the batter "out."
One feature that makes pes�pallo different from American baseball is the field it's played on. Instead of baseball's well-known diamond shape, a pes�pallo field is narrower and longer. Another difference is that the pitcher doesn't throw the ball to the batter from a pitcher's mound in the center of the field, like in baseball. Instead, the pes�pallo pitcher stands in front of the batter, and throws the ball straight up, at least one meter above the batter's head. And finally, in pes�pallo, runners run to the bases in a zigzag pattern, instead of counterclockwise. All these factors help to make pes�pallo a faster-paced game than baseball, with players running about 10 kilometers per game.
Today, pes�pallo is spreading around the world. Pes�pallo games are being played in India, Germany and Australia. Homerun for pes�pallo!




The World's Longest Horse Race
Sport
In many horse races, riders race horses around a track. But in Mongolia, there is a very different kind of horse race. In this race, riders try to complete a 1,000-kilometer route across Mongolia. This unusual horse race, called the Mongol Derby, is considered to be the longest and toughest horse race on Earth.
Each August, Mongol Derby participants attempt to finish the course in less than 10 days, riding up to 14 hours per day. They travel a route based on a mail delivery system created by Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan in the year 1224. Riders from all over the world, and of all different skill levels, compete. They pay around $15,000 to participate. A few days before the race begins, riders take part in a three-day training session.
During the race, competitors ride Mongolian horses (around three million roam the country). Every 40 kilometers, riders stop at a station to switch to new horses and let the other horses rest. Veterinarians monitor the horses' health at each station. Riders wear GPS trackers. This is to locate riders in case of emergency and so that fans can follow their progress online.
The Mongolian grasslands are a difficult terrain. Competitors ride over hills, through valleys and across rivers. They ride in high winds and extreme temperatures�from -40�C to 30�C. At each of the 25 stations along the route, local Mongolian families make sure competitors (and horses) have food and a place to sleep. This gives riders an opportunity to meet the local population and learn about their culture.
The Mongol Derby has strict rules about how much weight the horses can carry. Riders can only weigh 85 kilograms; and that's with riding gear, including the horse's saddle. They may only bring five kilograms of extra supplies, such as soap, a toothbrush, and a sleeping bag. Many riders bring medical supplies in case they get hurt. And many riders do get hurt; it's a very dangerous race. Fewer than half the riders finish. Yet more and more people sign up each year.
"I came here to push myself, to challenge myself," said one participant. "I've learned a lot about Mongolian culture. I've learned a lot about the horses. Most importantly, I've learned a lot about myself."

The World's Longest Horse Race

In Mongolia there is a special horse race. It's the longest and hardest horse race on Earth. It's the Mongol Derby.
In the Mongol Derby, riders have less than 10 days to race 1,000 kilometers across Mongolia. People from all over the world pay around $15,000 to compete. The course is based on a route Genghis Khan created to deliver mail in the year 1224. In 1224, messengers on horseback rode along the route delivering mail.
The Mongol Derby course is very difficult. It has hills and rivers. The weather makes it hard, too. Strong winds blow. Temperatures can reach 30�C and drop below -40�C. During the race, riders wear GPS trackers so people can find them in case of emergency.
Every 40 kilometers, riders stop at a horse station to get a new horse. This gives the horses a chance rest and get checked by veterinarians. At each of the race's 25 stations, local Mongolian families make sure riders have food and a place to sleep. This is an opportunity for riders to meet people from the area and experience Mongolian culture.
In addition to their riding gear, riders can carry five kilograms of extra supplies, such as soap, a toothbrush, and a sleeping bag. Many riders bring medical supplies in case they get hurt. And many do get hurt. Fewer than half actually finish the race. But that doesn't keep people from racing.
"I came here to push myself," said one rider. "I've learned a lot about Mongolian culture. I've learned a lot about the horses. Most importantly, I've learned a lot about myself."

In the 1977 movie Star Wars, people had weapons called "lightsabers". These were special swords, with lights. Some people liked the movie so much, they made their own lightsabers. Fighting with these lightsabers became very popular. Today, it is a real sport called lightsaber dueling.
Like all sports, lightsaber dueling has rules. First, fighters must wear special clothing. This is because the fighters hit each other with their lightsabers. (Don't worry - lightsabers aren't sharp!) When fighters hit another fighter with their lightsaber, they get points. The winner is the first fighter to get 15 points in three minutes. Some people say lightsaber dueling is just like the movie. The lightsabers look and sound like the ones in Star Wars. Also, the room stays dark during the fights. This makes it easy to see the lightsabers moving around.
Lightsaber dueling is popular all over the world. Maybe one day it will be an Olympic sport.

Lightsaber Dueling
Sport
Did you fight with toy lightsabers as a child? Lightsabers look like long, glowing sticks. The weapons, which thrilled movie audiences, were seen in the first Star Wars movie in 1977. Recently, movie magic and reality came together. The French Fencing Federation (FFF) officially accepted lightsaber dueling as a competitive sport.
In the movie, lightsabers were sharp enough to cut a person in half. But competition lightsabers aren't dangerous. Fighters hold a metal handle connected to a long cylinder of hard plastic. Many competition lightsabers even have sound effects, so they sound like the weapons in the movie. During a competition, fighters move the lightsaber in almost the same way as a traditional fencing weapon.
The FFF is France's official organization for the sport of fencing. It created rules for lightsaber competitions. Fighters wear protective masks and clothing. Inside a circle marked on the floor, they try to score points by hitting each other with their lightsabers. Each fight lasts three minutes. The winner is the first fighter to earn 15 points or is ahead at the end of the fight. Competitions take place in a dark room, making the lightsabers exciting to watch.
The FFF hopes that young people will become interested in the sport. The FFF's secretary general, Serge Aubailly, is worried about the lack of exercise in young people's lives. He believes mixing sport and modern technologies is one way to make participating feel "natural" for young fighters.
Fencing has been an Olympic sport since 1896. Could future Olympic Games include a lightsaber dueling event?

Did you fight with toy lightsabers as a child? Lightsabers are sword-like, fictional weapons that were introduced in the first Star Wars movie in 1977. Audiences were fascinated as they watched knights battling each other with glowing, futuristic lightsabers. But that was only make-believe...  or was it? Recently, fiction met reality when the French Fencing Federation (FFF) officially recognized lightsaber dueling as a competitive sport.
Though the FFF's announcement may be surprising to some, Charley Cummings, who co-founded the lightsaber dueling league, Saber Legion, has seen rapid, international growth since starting the league in 2015. "We're offering a sport to people who are not necessarily into football or baseball or soccer," Cummings says.
In the Star Wars movies, lightsabers had powerful lasers that could cut a person in half. Competition lightsabers, which use a long cylinder of hard plastic that lights up, aren't as dangerous. But many of them come with a computer chip that makes sound effects, giving them an authentic feel. During combat, a fighter holds onto the metal hilt and moves the lightsaber almost the same way as a traditional fencing saber.
As the official organization for the sport of fencing in France, the FFF created rules for lightsaber competitions. Fighters wear protective masks and body armor. They fight inside a circle marked on the floor and score points for hitting their opponents with their lightsaber. A fight lasts three minutes. The winner is the first fighter to earn 15 points or is ahead when the time is over. A darkened arena enhances the sport's visual appeal.
The FFF hopes their rules and acceptance of the sport will attract fighters from the younger generation. Young people "...don't do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs," says Serge Aubailly, the FFF's secretary general. He feels that this has become a public health issue and notes, "That is why we are trying to create a bond between our discipline and modern technologies, so participating in a sport feels natural." 
Fencing has been part of the Olympic Games since 1896. Could lightsaber dueling become the next great Olympic event?





For people with stress, anxiety, and depression, there are a variety of treatments. But the Brugmann University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, is offering an additional, unusual treatment. It is a "prescription" for free museum visits!
The hospital is using "museum prescriptions" along with other treatments for patients with mental health issues. Doctors at the Brugmann University Hospital worked with Delphine Houba, Brussel's deputy mayor in charge of culture, to create the program. For now, this is a trial program for six months. During the trial, patients can visit five museums or cultural spots in Brussels for free. They can also bring friends or family members.
Studies show a connection between museums - especially art museums - and mental health. "Art museums have great potential to positively impact people," says researcher Katherine Cotter of the University of Pennsylvania, "including reducing their stress..." Similarly, H�l�ne Boyer, Vice President of the of the Canadian medical association M�decins Francophones du Canada, says that spending time enjoying art can increase levels of serotonin in the body. Serotonin is a chemical that helps us feel good. A 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) report also stated that interacting with art can benefit people with mental health issues.
At the five participating Brussels institutions, patients can see fashion and art, learn about the history of Brussels, and even visit the city's sewers! One institution is the Fashion and Lace Museum, where visitors can look at clothing, lace and accessories dating from the 16th century to the present day. Another is Brussels City Museum, which has paintings, artifacts, and photographs showing Brussels through the ages.
In the trial program, patients discuss their museum experience with their doctors before and after each visit. Doctors hear what the patients liked or didn't like about the visit. Then, they analyze the results to find out if the visits were helpful. If the museum prescription program is successful, it will be open to more cultural institutions and more patients. There have been programs like this in other places such as Montreal, Canada. But Houba believes it's the first of its kind in Europe.
So, if you're coping with stress and anxiety, a trip to the museum might be just what the doctor ordered!

Museums as Medicine?
Health
It's not unusual to get a prescription for medicine from a doctor. But have you ever received a prescription for a free museum visit? That's exactly what doctors at a hospital in Brussels, Belgium, are prescribing to patients who are dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression.
In a new program at Brugmann University Hospital, patients with stress or anxiety are being given (along with other treatments) free admission to five different museums in Brussels. Family members or friends can go too. The World Health Organization (WHO) looked at thousands of studies on culture and health. In 2019, WHO reported that interacting with art is good for our physical and mental health.
Doctors speak with patients before and after each visit. That way, doctors can find out if the visits are helpful. The hospital is trying the program for six months. If it is successful, more museums will be encouraged to participate.
One museum patients can visit with their prescription is the Fashion and Lace Museum. It has clothing, lace, and accessories from the 16th century. They can also visit the Brussels City Museum, which has objects, paintings, and photographs showing the history of Brussels.
For the doctors at Brugmann University Hospital, the museum prescriptions are an important part of a treatment plan for patients with mental health issues. Delphine Houba, Brussel's deputy mayor in charge of culture, says it's the first program of its kind in Europe. Houba worked with the doctors to create the program and feels very proud of it.
For people with anxiety or depression, a trip to the museum may be just what the doctor ordered!

Museums as Medicine?
Health
When people feel sick, they often go to a doctor. And the doctor often gives them a prescription for medicine. But now, doctors in a hospital in Brussels are giving some patients another, unusual kind of prescription. This prescription is for a trip to a museum!
Brugmann University Hospital has a program for people who have anxiety. The patients get their regular treatment, but they also get to visit museums for free. They can also bring a friend or someone in their family. Doctors think that looking at art will help the patients feel better. As they enjoy the art, they will have less anxiety.
One museum that patients can visit is the Brussels City Museum. There, patients can learn about the history of Brussels. At Centrale, patients can see modern art. Patients can also visit the Fashion and Lace Museum. It has very old clothing and accessories.
Right now, there are five museums patients can visit. But hopefully, more will join soon. Because pills can be medicine. But art can be medicine too!




Let Telemedicine Help!
Health
Today, many people are staying home because of COVID-19. But some people feel ill. They want to see a doctor. But they don't want to go to a hospital or doctor's office. They're afraid to get COVID-19. What can they do? They can use "telemedicine." With telemedicine, they don't have to go out. Doctors use technology to treat patients at home.
There are three kinds of telemedicine. One is "store and forward." An example is when a doctor needs advice from an expert. The doctor sends a patient's tests to the expert over the computer. The expert looks at the tests and gives the doctor advice.
Another kind of telemedicine is "live interaction." A doctor sees patients over the computer. They do video chats. Sometimes they speak on the phone.
The third kind of telemedicine is "remote monitoring." Patients have a special device at home. It checks their health. It might check their weight or blood sugar. Then, it sends this information to doctors' smartphones.
Telemedicine isn't new. But COVID-19, is making telemedicine very popular.

Let Telemedicine Help!
Health
Today, hospitals are filled with people who have the COVID-19 virus. But what about people with other illnesses? They need help, too. But many don't want to go to the hospital or doctor's office. They're afraid they'll catch the virus. Doctors treat these patients using "telemedicine." Telemedicine uses technology to treat patients at home.
There are different kinds of telemedicine. Doctors may use just one type, or a mixture of different kinds. One kind of telemedicine is "live interaction." Doctors speak with patients over video chat, or even just over the phone.
Sometimes a doctor needs advice from a specialist. If they're in different places, they can use a kind of telemedicine called "store and forward." The doctor sends x-rays or other tests electronically to the specialist, and gets his or her advice.
"Remote monitoring" telemedicine helps patients who live far away from hospitals. Nurses visit these patients at home. The nurse checks the person's weight and gives them blood tests. Then, the nurse sends the information to a doctor. There are also devices that patients can use to check themselves. An app sends the information directly to doctors' smartphones.
Today, because of COVID-19, more patients are interested in using telemedicine than ever before. According to General Brigham, a healthcare company in Boston, USA, before the COVID crisis, around 1,600 patients a month used telemedicine. During the crisis, the number jumped up to 242,000!
No one knows what will happen when the crisis is over. Doctors will always need to see some patients face-to-face. But now, more people might appreciate the convenience of telemedicine. Many experts believe that telemedicine is here to stay.

Let Telemedicine Help!
Health
Staff in hospitals across the globe are working tirelessly, caring for patients infected with COVID-19. To reduce the spread of the virus, countries have been asking their citizens to stay home as much as possible, and only go out in cases of emergency. But how can patients with other illnesses, who have gone to hospitals or doctors' offices before the pandemic, receive care? One answer is "telemedicine." Telemedicine uses electronic communications (such as e-mail and video chat) along with software, to treat patients remotely. Telemedicine allows doctors to interact with patients without seeing them in person.
There are three common types of telemedicine. "Live interaction" telemedicine allows patients and doctors to speak in real time using the telephone or video conferencing. Another type is "store and forward," in which doctors can share x-rays and test results with specialists at another location. This enables doctors to consult with each other no matter where they are - even if they're in different countries.
With a third type of telemedicine, "remote monitoring," patients (or nurses who visit patients' homes) check their blood pressure, blood sugar levels, or weight, at home. Then, they send the information to a doctor. There are also self-monitoring devices, such as personal EKG machines, with an app that sends results directly to doctors' smartphones. Remote monitoring helps people who live in rural settings, far from doctors and hospitals. It also helps people who are elderly and those with chronic diseases. Doctors might choose to use just one type of telemedicine, or a combination of them.
Many people hadn't even heard of telemedicine before the COVID-19 crisis, but stay-at-home orders have made telemedicine more popular than ever. About a month before the COVID-19 crisis in the USA, the healthcare company, General Brigham, in Boston, treated 1,600 patients via video visits. Then, as the crisis took hold, the number of video visits went up to 242,000!
No one knows what healthcare will be like after the pandemic. And there will still be patients who need to see doctors in person. But as more people learn about telemedicine, and see its effectiveness and efficiency, there's a good chance they'll continue to use it. According to many experts, telemedicine is going to transform healthcare... permanently.





Do you start your day with a cup of coffee? Although we don't know exactly when people first began drinking coffee, we do know that millions of people around the world start their day with it. But lately, in a world that has become more and more aware of the benefits of a healthy diet, people worry about their coffee. It seems like every week there's a new study about coffee - and each new study often disagrees with the one before. Research has shown both health risks and benefits of coffee. Maybe that's why many people keep looking for healthier ways to get their daily fix. One new coffee trend has an unexpected and completely natural ingredient - mushrooms!
There are more than 10,000 different types of mushrooms in the world. One variety, which people have used in drinks for centuries, is called chaga. Chaga tea, for example, is a popular drink in Finland, where people drink it to relax. The black chaga mushrooms grow on trees, have important nutrients such as vitamin D, and may help protect against brain illnesses such as Alzheimer's. Chaga, which also helps strengthen the immune system, is a common ingredient in mushroom coffee.
While growing up on a farm in Finland, Tero Isokauppila picked mushrooms regularly. "A lot of people have a very strong opinion of mushrooms; they either love them or hate them," says Isokauppila, who believes in the medicinal properties of mushrooms. In 2012, Isokauppila founded a company called Four Sigmatic, selling coffee with chaga and other types of mushrooms. To make the coffee, mushrooms are picked, dried and made into a powder. Then, the powder is mixed with instant coffee. One health benefit is that instant mushroom coffee contains half the caffeine of a normal cup of coffee.
So, how does mushroom coffee taste? Dietician Ayla Gentiletti tried it and thought it was bitter, saying, "I've heard it tastes much better with coffee creamer and sweetener!" But others say it tastes just like regular coffee, and recommend it for people who want to make their coffee habit healthier. Though Gentiletti says more research needs to be done on mushroom coffee's health claims, it looks like the mushroom coffee trend will continue. Maybe mushroom milk and sugar will be next!

Millions of people around the world love coffee. But some worry about their favorite drink. Is it healthy? Researchers say there are both risks and benefits to coffee. That's why people are always looking for healthier coffee - for example, mushroom coffee!
There are more than 10,000 different kinds of mushrooms in the world. One kind is called chaga. People have used chaga in drinks for centuries. In Finland, people drink tea with chaga mushrooms to relax. Chaga is used in many mushroom coffees too. The black chaga mushrooms grow on trees. They have important nutrients such as vitamin D. Chaga may also help keep our brains healthy.
Tero Isokauppila, who grew up in Finland, started a company called Four Sigmatic in 2012. The company sells coffee with chaga and other types of mushrooms. Isokauppila believes that mushrooms have the power to heal. But not everyone likes the idea of mushrooms. "A lot of people have a very strong opinion of mushrooms; they either love them or hate them," says Isokauppila.
To make mushroom coffee, mushrooms are dried and made into a powder. Then, the powder is mixed with instant coffee. And how does it taste? Some people say mushroom coffee is too bitter. Others say it tastes exactly like coffee. One thing is sure: a cup of instant mushroom coffee has half the caffeine of a regular cup of coffee. Although more research needs to be done on the health benefits of mushroom coffee, it looks like the trend will continue. One day there may even be mushroom milk and sugar for your coffee!

Millions of people love coffee. They drink it every day. But is coffee healthy? Scientists don't agree on the answer. So, people are trying to make coffee healthy. Now there is a new kind of coffee - mushroom coffee!
Chaga is a kind of mushroom. It's black, and grows on trees. Chaga mushrooms are very healthy. They also have a lot of vitamins. In Finland, people make tea with chaga mushrooms. It helps them relax.
Tero Isokauppila is from Finland. He wanted to help people stay healthy. He mixed chaga mushrooms with instant coffee. People liked Isokauppila's special coffee. In 2012, Isokauppila started a company called Four Sigmatic. The company sells coffee with chaga and other mushrooms.
So, is mushroom coffee healthy? Scientists don't know yet. But we do know one thing. It has less caffeine than other coffee. Mushroom coffee is popular. But some people don't like the taste. They say it's better with lots of milk and sugar!




Dopamine Fasting
Health
Sometimes people fast; they don't eat or drink. But there are other kinds of fasts, too. There are dopamine fasts. During a dopamine fast, you don't do enjoyable activities, like listen to music or text friends.
Dopamine is a chemical in the brain. Dopamine tells the body how to move and feel. Some people think enjoyable activities give the brain too much dopamine. Too much dopamine makes people want to do the activities more and more. It's hard to stop! So, they go on a dopamine fast to rest their brains.
On a dopamine fast, some people don't use technology, read books, or go shopping. Other people are very strict. They stop doing most things. What do they do? They might take walks, meditate, and write (with a pen, not a computer).
Does "dopamine" fasting really lessen your dopamine? Many scientists who study the brain say no. They do think it's good to take a break from some habits. An example is always checking messages on your phone. Scientists say it's good to give your brain a break!

Dopamine Fasting
Health
Four times a year, James Sinka, the CEO of a company in California, USA, gives his brain a rest. First, he tells family and friends he won't be in contact for a while. Then, he begins a kind of fast that's becoming popular in the U.S. Normally when you fast, you don't eat (and often drink) for a certain period of time. But when Sinka fasts, he does a lot more than not eat. He turns off his electronic devices, for example, and only uses natural light. This kind of fast is a "dopamine fast."
Dopamine is a complicated brain chemical. It's linked to motivation and feelings. People who take on dopamine fasts believe that stimulating activities flood the brain with dopamine. This causes people to feel "addicted" to those activities. During a dopamine fast, people stop doing those activities to let their brains recharge.
For some people, stimulating activities might include shopping, reading books, listening to music or using the Internet. Sinka is stricter. He also stays away from people and doesn't even make eye contact! What will Sinka do during a fast? He'll write (with a pen), meditate and take walks. He'll also drink water.
There's no rule about how long a dopamine fast should last. But it's common for people to fast for 24 hours. Many people say that after a dopamine fast they have more energy, motivation and focus.
Not everyone believes in dopamine fasting. Many neuroscientists say these fasts have nothing to do with dopamine at all. But they do think it's helpful to temporarily stop doing certain behaviors � like checking your phone � and to give your brain a break!

Dopamine Fasting
Health
Four times a year, James Sinka, the CEO of a start-up, apologizes to his family and friends for being temporarily unreachable. Then he begins a type of fast that's becoming popular in Silicon Valley and other parts of the U.S. While typical fasting involves not eating or drinking for a certain length of time, Sinka's fast involves a lot more. He turns off his smartphone and other devices, stays clear of artificial light, and begins his "dopamine fast."
Dopamine is a complicated brain chemical linked to motivation, emotion, and learning. The thought behind the fast is that stimulating activities and behaviors (like checking social media apps) increase dopamine in your brain. And the more dopamine, the more you feel like you're getting "addicted" to those behaviors. By refraining from doing those activities for a certain period of time - a dopamine fast - you're basically pushing the "reset" button on your brain. 
People conduct dopamine fasts in different ways. Some people avoid enjoyable activities such as shopping, reading books, listening to music and using the Internet. Other people are much stricter. Sinka, for example, refrains from most activities, including interacting with people. He won't even make eye contact. What does Sinka allow himself to do during a fast? He'll write (using pen and paper), take walks, meditate, and drink water to stay hydrated.
A dopamine fast can last as long as you want, though many people fast for at least 24 hours. What are the results? Some fasters claim they feel more motivated the day after a fast. Many feel an increase in energy and focus. Others describe having a deeper connection with people.
However, not everyone is sold on dopamine fasts. Some neuroscientists have stated that these fasts most likely have nothing to do with dopamine. Joshua Berke, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, says he's not aware of any evidence that avoiding stimulating activities can reduce dopamine levels in the brain.
But whether they believe the science or not, most people do agree that taking a break from certain habits is a good idea. So, go ahead and give your brain a break!




Blue Spaces
Health
Are you one of the billions of people around the globe living in a crowded, polluted city? In recent years, cities have been creating "green spaces," like parks and sports fields, to help residents relax and recharge. But did you know that "blue spaces" have similar - and possibly more - benefits to green spaces? Blue spaces are areas with water. These can include oceans, rivers, lakes, and even the fountain at your local shopping mall. Research has shown that living close to, or spending time in, blue spaces is good for your mental and physical health.
Maybe you've already felt that spending time near water improves your mood, but science actually confirms it. Connecting with the natural environment lowers stress levels. At the beach, for example, the sight and sound of the waves ebbing and flowing change your brain patterns. This puts you into a deeply relaxed state of mind - goodbye city stress! Even just looking out at water has been associated with better mental health. Dr. Lewis Elliott, of the University of Exeter, in England, says our mental health can improve by spending around two hours a week in blue spaces. Additionally, scientists have shown that blue makes most people feel calm and peaceful. Several studies have also found that blue boosts creativity.
The emotional benefits that blue spaces provide are also accompanied by physical benefits. Researchers have found that spending time in less polluted environments close to the ocean improves physical health. A specific study, conducted by Professor Michael Depledge and environmental psychologist Mat White showed that people who live by the coast of England report better physical health than those who live further away. How do blue spaces keep us healthy? Being next to the beach means more exposure to sunlight, which our bodies need to make vitamin D. Vitamin D is crucial for keeping bones strong. A beach or waterfront also offers opportunities to be physically active in a serene and natural environment. You can walk or run along the shore, play beach volleyball, or go for a swim.
 
So, next time the city is getting you down, take a break with some blue space!

Do you live in a city? Crowded, polluted cities can be stressful. Stress affects people's health. In recent years, cities have been creating "green spaces," like parks and sports fields, to help people feel healthier. But spending time in "blue spaces" can also help. Blue spaces are areas with water. These can include oceans, rivers, lakes, and even fountains. Research shows that living close to, or spending time in, these blue spaces keeps our minds and bodies healthy.
Many people say spending time near water improves their mood, and scientists agree. Researchers say that people feel less stressed when they are out in nature. In fact, the sight and sound of the waves on a beach actually change people's brain patterns, making them feel relaxed. Even just looking out at water can help. Dr. Lewis Elliott, of the University of Exeter in England, says our mental health can improve by spending around two hours a week in blue spaces. Scientists who study color have also shown that the color blue makes most people feel calm.
So how do blue spaces keep our bodies healthy? Being next to the ocean means more sunlight. Humans need sunlight to make vitamin D, which keeps bones strong. A study by Professor Michael Depledge and environmental psychologist Mat White found that those living by the coast of England are healthier than those living further away.
Being on the beach or waterfront also encourages physical activity. People go walking or jogging along the shore. They play beach sports or go swimming. This improves their physical health.
So, when you need a break from the city, visit a blue space and relax!

Do you know anyone with dementia? Dementia makes it hard to remember things. In Japan, millions of people have dementia. Their lives aren't easy. Many of them are old, and very lonely. In Tokyo, you can visit a special restaurant. Its name is Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.  Why is it special? All the waiters and waitresses have dementia!
People with dementia like working in the restaurant. It helps them feel useful. They can meet new people. Then, they don't feel lonely. "I'm so glad I came. It's been just wonderful," says one 90-year-old waitress.
Waiters don't usually make mistakes at Japanese restaurants. That's not true at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders. The waiters make a lot of mistakes. But customers don't get angry. They expect to get the wrong food!
Shiro Oguni started Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in 2015. He wanted people in Japan to meet people with dementia. He hoped to change their feelings about people with dementia. At Restaurant of Mistaken Orders, people are all just people.

Health
In Japan, 4.6 million people have dementia, and they are mainly older people. Two-thirds of them live at home, and often feel very lonely. People with dementia have a hard time remembering things. So, it may seem strange to give them a job where memory is important. But at a special pop-up restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, all the waiters and waitresses have dementia. It's called Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.
In most Japanese restaurants, waiters and waitresses almost never make mistakes. However, that's not true at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders. For example, one waiter served hot coffee with a straw, and another sat down at the table with customers. So, what's the point? Working helps people with dementia feel useful. They meet new people at the restaurant, and the work gives them confidence. "I was worried. I wasn't sure if I could do this job," says one 90-year-old waitress, "but I'm so glad I came. It's been just wonderful."
Shiro Oguni started Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in 2015. He got the idea while directing a film about dementia. He heard many negative opinions about people with dementia. Oguni hoped to change these opinions. He decided to create a place where customers could interact with people who have dementia. Customers know they probably won't get what they ordered, so they just relax and enjoy the experience. When they see the waiters and waitresses having a good time, they begin to see people with dementia in a more positive way. Food blogger Mizuho Kudo wrote a favorable review about her meal - even though her order was wrong!
What do you think? Would you eat at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders?

Health
Have you ever met a person with dementia? According to the World Health Organization, around 50 million people in the world have dementia, and they're mainly older people. In Japan, for example, 4.6 million people have dementia. Two-thirds of these people live at home, often isolated from society. The condition affects brain functions including memory, making it hard for a person with dementia to remember things. It might seem impossible for a person who can't remember things to work as a waiter, but there is a pop-up restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, where everyone on the waitstaff has dementia. It's called Restaurant of Mistaken Orders.
Receiving perfect service is part of Japanese restaurant culture, and mistakes are rarely made. That isn't true for Restaurant of Mistaken Orders, where waitstaff might sit down with customers at their tables or serve hot coffee with a straw. However, at this restaurant, customers are very understanding of the elderly volunteer waiters who love having a job to do. Working in the pleasant atmosphere of the restaurant gives the waiters a sense of purpose and a chance to interact with new people, and it boosts their self-confidence. "I was worried. I wasn't sure if I could do this job," says one 90-year-old waitress, "but I'm so glad I came. It's been just wonderful."
Television director Shiro Oguni got the idea for Restaurant of Mistaken Orders while working on a documentary about dementia. The experience helped him understand the scope of the problem as well as the daily challenges that people with dementia face. Oguni decided to create a place that would change negative opinions of people with dementia, opening the first pop-up in 2015.
Restaurant of Mistaken Orders is less about getting the food you ordered, and more about interacting with people who have dementia. Diners know they probably won't get what they ordered, so they can relax and enjoy the experience. When they see the waitstaff having a good time, they also begin to see people with dementia in a more positive way. The restaurant has even gotten attention on social media. When food blogger Mizuho Kudo ordered a hamburger and received dumplings instead, she still posted a favorable review.
So, would you like to eat at Restaurant of Mistaken Orders?





Today, most processed foods have sugar. But too much sugar is dangerous to your health. Some people sweeten their foods with sugar substitutes, but many of these are unhealthy, too. What if there was a healthy sugar substitute? A company in Mexico called XiliNat (pronounced Hill-ee-natt) is making just that!
Javier Larragoiti is a Mexican biochemist who founded XiliNat in 2016. When Larragoiti was 18, his father was diagnosed with diabetes. People with diabetes must avoid foods with sugar because their bodies don't make enough insulin to control the sugar in their blood. But the sugar-free lifestyle was too challenging for Larragoiti's father. He tried using sugar substitutes, such as stevia and sucralose, to satisfy his "sweet tooth", but he hated the taste, so it was hard for him to stick to his diet. Larragoiti decided to help. 
Larragoiti began researching the sweetener xylitol, used in products such as gum and candy. Xylitol looks and tastes like sugar, but has fewer calories. Another benefit is that it actually keeps teeth healthy by protecting them from cavities. Xylitol often comes from wood, and is very expensive to make. Larragoiti looked for a cheaper way to make xylitol, so that it could be accessible to everyone.
After a lot of research, Larragoiti found a solution. Through his company XiliNat, he patented a process that makes xylitol from corn cobs instead of wood. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Mexico grows 27.5 million tons of corn each year. However, only the kernels are used, leaving the cobs behind as agricultural waste. Farmers often burn the cobs, polluting the atmosphere. XiliNat helps the environment by buying farmers' organic waste from the corn, and using it to make the xylitol. XiliNat is currently producing one ton of the product each year.
So far, XiliNat is succeeding in its mission to avoid pollution, reduce health issues and provide extra income to corn farmers. And the company's product could help the approximately 400 million people in the world suffering from diabetes. What does Larragoiti's father think? "My dad is super happy," says Larragoiti. "He uses my product every day and he's willing not to cheat on his diet anymore!"

Too much sugar is dangerous to your health. People who are trying to eat healthier often use sugar substitutes. But many sugar substitutes are actually unhealthy. Now, a company in Mexico called XiliNat (pronounced Hill-ee-natt), has created a healthy sugar substitute made from corn.
Javier Larragoiti started XiliNat to help his father, who has diabetes. With diabetes, a person's body doesn't make enough insulin to control the sugar in their blood. So, people with diabetes can't eat foods with sugar. After Larragoiti's father found out he had diabetes, he had a hard time eating less sugar. He tried using sugar substitutes, but he hated the taste. Looking for a solution, Larragoiti, a biochemist, began researching xylitol. The sugar substitute, used in products such as gum and candy, looks and tastes like sugar but has fewer calories. Another advantage of xylitol is that it keeps teeth healthy by protecting them from cavities. Xylitol usually comes from wood, and is very expensive to make. Larragoiti found a cheaper way to make xylitol. He uses corn cobs instead of wood.
In Mexico, 27.5 million tons of corn are grown each year. However, only the kernels are used; the rest is waste. Farmers often burn the cobs, which pollutes the atmosphere. By buying the corn waste and using it to make xylitol, XiliNat helps the environment and the farmers. Now, instead of burning the waste, farmers receive extra income by selling it to XiliNat.
XiliNat's product could help the approximately 400 million people in the world with diabetes. Larragoiti says his father happily uses XiliNat's product every day... and doesn't cheat on his diet anymore.

Do you put artificial sweeteners in your food? Many people think that artificial sweeteners are healthier than sugar. But most artificial sweeteners are unhealthy. Now, a company in Mexico called XiliNat is making a healthy sweetener.
Javier Larragoiti is a biochemist. He started the company XiliNat to help people who have diabetes. With diabetes, a person's body doesn't make enough insulin to control the sugar in their blood. People with diabetes can't eat foods with sugar.
XiliNat makes a sweetener called xylitol. Xylitol looks and tastes like sugar. But it has fewer calories than sugar. Companies usually make xylitol from wood. Using wood costs a lot of money. XiliNat uses corn cobs to make xylitol. Using corn cobs is cheaper than using wood. Mexican farmers grow 27.5 million tons of corn each year. They sell the corn kernels, and burn the rest of the plant. This pollutes the environment. XiliNat buys the farmers' corn cobs. So Xilinat helps the farmers and the environment.
XiliNat will also help the millions of people in the world who have diabetes.




The Healthiest Snack
Health
Do you like to exercise? Exercise helps keep you healthy. But what if you don't enjoy going to the gym? Or what if you just can't find the time? Then try an exercise snack, instead!
An "exercise snack" means doing a little exercise in a very short amount of time. Experts say adults need 150 minutes of exercise a week to stay healthy. But you don't have to go to the gym to get exercise. You can climb up and down stairs a few times a day. You can dance to your favorite song. You can also run up and down a hallway for four minutes. Every minute of "exercise snacking" you do each day helps keep you fit.
Exercise snacking burns calories and helps you sleep better. It also helps your posture. In one study, researchers found that exercise snacks make your heart and lungs stronger.
So, what are you waiting for? Start snacking!

Are you someone who can't find time to exercise? Well, there's a solution to your problem - exercise snacks!
The phrase "exercise snack" refers to very short, intense sessions of exercise spread out over a day. And you can do them almost anywhere. Try climbing up and down flights of stairs, dancing to your favorite song, or running back and forth along a hallway for four minutes. Professor of kinesiology Martin Gibala believes people don't need an hour-long workout at the gym to get fit. Gibala led a recent study from McMaster University in Canada. According to the study, exercise snacks can make your heart and lungs stronger, and improve your overall physical fitness.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sitting too much (six or more hours per day) is one of the leading factors for fatal diseases worldwide. The WHO recommends adults do 150 minutes of exercise a week to stay healthy. However, this exercise doesn't have to be done all at once. Short bursts of exercise for just a few minutes (spread out over a day) add up over time.
So, instead of taking a coffee break at work, "...why not take a movement break?" asks Lauren Parsons, a wellness specialist and personal trainer. Exercise snacking improves sleep and helps your posture, while also burning calories. Parsons believes that if you can find time to brush your teeth every day to keep them healthy, you can take "a minute here, a minute there, throughout the day and see what a difference it makes."
You probably won't hear this often, but... start snacking!

Are you someone who can't find time to exercise? You might have even tried going to the gym, but found it inconvenient or intimidating. Well, there's a solution to your exercise problem - exercise snacks!
An "exercise snack" isn't some sort of nutrition bar. The phrase refers to very brief intervals of high-intensity training spread out over a day. This may include climbing up and down flights of stairs, dancing to your favorite song, or running back and forth along a hallway for four minutes.
 
"Some people have the notion that 'exercise' means changing into spandex and heading to the gym for an hour-long workout," says professor of kinesiology Martin Gibala. But that's not the only way to get fit. Gibala is the lead author of a recent study from McMaster University in Canada. According to the study, exercise snacks can strengthen your heart and lungs, and improve your overall physical fitness.
The term "exercise snack" was coined in a 2014 study from the University of Otago in New Zealand. In the study, one-minute intervals of intense exercise before a meal helped people with diabetes control their blood sugar.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), living a sedentary lifestyle is one of the leading risk factors worldwide for illnesses which can be fatal, such as heart disease and diabetes. Being sedentary is defined as sitting for six or more hours per day, which is a concern since so many workers sit this long or longer. The WHO recommends adults do 150 minutes of exercise a week to stay healthy. This exercise doesn't have to be done in large chunks. It can be done in small "bites". Short bursts of exercise spread out over a day add up over time.
So, instead of taking a coffee break at work, "...why not take a movement break?" asks Lauren Parsons, a wellness specialist and personal trainer. In addition to burning calories, the benefits of exercise snacking include better sleep and improved posture.

Sleep on It!
Health
How many hours of sleep do you get each night? Most doctors agree that good sleep habits keep the human body healthy. Although the World Health Organization recommends that adults sleep eight hours each night, more than a third of American adults don't get enough sleep. In recent years, researchers have been discovering the serious consequences that lack of sleep has on human health.
Research links sleep deprivation to health problems, including cancer, heart attacks, Alzheimer's, and obesity. For example, people who are sleep deprived will actually eat somewhere between three to five hundred calories more each day than normal. Lack of sleep also contributes to workplace injuries and decreased productivity. In addition, 20 percent of all car accidents each year are caused by tired drivers - that's more than one million!
Dr. Matthew Walker, professor at the University of California, Berkeley in the USA, is the founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science. In his bestselling book Why We Sleep, Walker discusses the global "sleep-loss epidemic", and the importance of getting enough sleep. For instance, sleep strengthens the immune system, helping the body fight illness. Additionally, sleeping before and after learning new information helps you remember it better than if you hadn't slept. During sleep, the body restores itself. "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day," says Walker. Walker also explains that humans sleep in 90-minute cycles. At the end of each cycle, they go into deep sleep. But "One cycle isn't enough to do all the work. You need four or five cycles to get all the benefit," says Walker.
Many people think of sleep deprivation as a badge of honor, labelling those who sleep eight hours each night "lazy". The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) says around 47 million adults don't get a restorative night's sleep. The organization wants to educate people, to help change society's views about prioritizing sleep. The NSF recommends later start times for teenagers in school, and flexible work schedules for adults. Working and studying during the part of the day when people are most alert improves productivity and academic performance.

Doctors say that adults need eight hours of sleep each night. But many people sleep less. This is a mistake.  Getting enough sleep is very important.
First, sleep keeps people healthy. People get very sick when they don't sleep enough. Also, people who don't sleep enough can't work well or quickly. It can also be dangerous. They can get hurt more easily. Tired drivers cause one million car accidents each year!
Dr. Matthew Walker is a sleep scientist. Walker explains that sleep helps our brains. Sleeping makes our memory better. Sleep also helps our bodies heal more quickly when we are sick, or hurt.
Scientists say we need to change our ideas about sleep. They believe that school should start later for students. With enough sleep, students are able to learn better. People should also be able to begin their workday later.

Do you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses? If not, you probably know someone who does. According to the World Health Organization, more than 200 million people in the world have vision problems, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness. While many choose to wear glasses or contact lenses to improve their vision, others choose to have invasive laser eye surgery for a more permanent cure. But what if you could see better without eyewear or surgery? A new medical invention could be the solution - it's called "Nano-Drops".
Nano-Drops are special eye drops that can correct vision problems. The drops work together with a smartphone and a small laser device attached to the smartphone. Nano-Drops were developed in Israel by a team of researchers, including ophthalmologist Dr. David Smadja from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, and Professor Zeev Zalevsky from Bar-Ilan University.
Unlike surgery, the new Nano-Drops method is painless and non-invasive. The method involves three steps. First, patients use a smartphone app to measure the adjustments that their eyes need. Then, based on the information from the app, a laser pattern is created and projected onto the surface of the cornea for a few milliseconds. This creates tiny grooves in the cornea. Finally, the patient puts Nano-Drops containing nanoparticles into each eye. These special particles enter the grooves, making the necessary corrections to the eyes. The patented Nano-Drops method is also convenient, as the process of correction can be done at home without the need for a medical doctor. The downside is that as the eye gradually heals itself, patients will have to repeat the process every month or two.
The Nano-Drops have already successfully treated nearsightedness and farsightedness in pigs (whose eyes are very similar to human eyes). Testing on humans will begin soon. "I hope that within two years the product may be available [on] the market," says Prof. Zalevsky. Dr. Smadja feels confident that this revolutionary invention could help many people say "goodbye" to their glasses!

Dr. David Smadja, an ophthalmologist, and a team of researchers in Israel have developed a new medical invention. It could help people see better without glasses, contact lenses, or surgery - it's called "Nano-Drops".
There are three steps to using Nano-Drops. First, patients measure their eyesight using a smartphone app. Based on the information from the app, a laser pattern is created. Then, the laser pattern is projected onto the eye. In less than a second, the laser makes tiny grooves on the eye's surface. Finally, the patient puts Nano-Drops into each eye. The nanoparticles in the drops enter the grooves, making the necessary corrections to the eyes.
The World Health Organization says that more than 200 million people in the world have vision problems, such as nearsightedness and farsightedness. Some people wear glasses or contact lenses to see more clearly. Others choose to have laser eye surgery to fix their vision more permanently. But eye surgery can be painful. The new Nano-Drops are painless, as well as non-invasive. Nano-Drops also make treatment easier because it can be done at home, without a doctor. However, Nano-Drops' effects don't last forever, because the eye gradually heals itself. Patients will have to use the Nano-Drops every month or two.
Researchers have already tested Nano-Drops on pigs, and will soon begin testing on humans. They hope that Nano-Drops will be on the market within two years. Dr. Smadja believes that this invention could help many people say "Goodbye" to their glasses!

Do you wear glasses or contact lenses? Well, you may not need them anymore! A new invention can help you see better without glasses. Say "Hello" to "Nano-Drops"!
Nano-Drops are special eye drops. There are three steps to using Nano-Drops. First, the patient checks their eyes with a smartphone app. The app gets information about the patient's eyes. Then, a laser makes tiny cuts on top of the eye - it happens in less than a second! Finally, the patient puts Nano-Drops into their eyes. The nanoparticles in the Nano-Drops go into the small cuts in the eye. Now, the patient can see well. Patients will have to do this process every month or two. But they can do it at home without a doctor.
Researchers in Israel made Nano-Drops. They tested Nano-Drops on pigs' eyes. Next, they want to test the drops on humans. The researchers are very excited. They hope that Nano-Drops will be for sale very soon. Say "Goodbye" to glasses!





Hearing aids help people hear. Canes help people walk. Medical devices help people with many different health conditions. But these devices don't always look nice.

Now, things are changing. Researchers, designers, and people with health conditions are working together. They are making medical devices that are fashionable! You can see 70 of these devices at an exhibition in New York City. It is called "Access+Ability".

One device in the exhibition is called "Earring Aid. It is a hearing aid that looks like jewelry. At Access+Ability, there are also covers for prosthetic legs.  The covers come in different colors and designs.

At "Access+Ability" you can even see a pair of trendy Nike shoes. The shoes have zippers that go all around the shoe. This makes the shoes easy to put on. Nike made these shoes because of a boy with cerebral palsy. The boy wrote a letter to Nike. He asked them to make shoes he can put on by himself. So they did!

These new medical devices are changing people's lives.

What if people could choose prosthetic leg covers like they choose shirts? Most products that help people with health conditions, such as hearing aids and prosthetic legs, are useful but not very attractive.

Researchers, designers, and people with physical, cognitive, and sensory challenges are working together to change this. They have designed many products that are both useful and fashionable. You can see more than 70 of these products at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in an exhibition called "Access+Ability".

One product, called the "Emma" watch was created by a graphic designer named Emma Lawton. Lawton has Parkinson's disease. In order to help her control her hand, she made a watch that uses a special technology called haptic vibration. The "Magnetic Shirt" also helps people with Parkinson's. The shirt has magnets instead of buttons, so it's easier to close. One of the shirt's designers, Maura Horton, wanted to make a shirt that her husband, who has Parkinson's, can put on by himself.

The exhibition also includes a pair of Nike shoes. The shoes have zippers that wrap all the way around the shoe. This makes it easier to put them on. Nike made these shoes because of a letter from a 13-year-old boy with cerebral palsy. He wanted a cool pair of shoes he could put on without help. Now, he has one!

At Access+Ability, there are also prosthetic leg covers, in different patterns. And "Earring Aid", designed by artist Elana Langer, is a hearing aid. It is decorated with Swarovski crystals, making them look like jewelry.

These new products not only help people physically, they help them emotionally, too!

Imagine someone with a prosthetic leg choosing a leg cover from their closet as if choosing a pair of pants. Or how about someone accessorizing with a pair of hearing aids? Traditionally, medically assistive products, such as hearing aids, prosthetic limbs, compression socks, and canes, have served purely functional purposes; fashion has never played a role. Until now.

Thanks to the collaboration of researchers, designers, and people with physical, cognitive, and sensory challenges, a range of products has been developed to be not just functional, but fashionable, too. More than 70 of these products are on display at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, in an exhibition called "Access+Ability".

Most of the products in Access+Ability were designed or inspired by someone with a disability. The "Emma" watch is the creation of graphic designer Emma Lawton, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2013. The trendy-looking watch uses special technology called haptic vibration to allow wearers with Parkinson's to regain control of their hands.

The "Magnetic Shirt" is another example of a fashionable yet functional solution for people with Parkinson's. Designed by Duncan Fitzsimons and Maura Horton, the shirt closes with magnets, which are easier to use than buttons. Horton designed the shirt to help her husband - who has Parkinson's - dress independently, to help him keep his dignity.

Also in the exhibition is a pair of stylish Nike shoes, which came about as the result of a letter written by Matthew Walzer, a 13-year-old with cerebral palsy. Walzer asked for a pair of shoes he could put on without help. Nike responded with its "FlyEase" shoes. They have wraparound zippers, which make them easy to put on.

Also on display are Alleles Design Studios' prosthetic leg covers, which come in many colors and patterns. Their mission is "to do for prosthetics what fashion did for eyeglasses". Artist Elana Langer has the same mission for her "Earring Aid", hearing aids decorated with Swarovski crystals, so they look like jewelry.

The co-curator of Access+Ability, Cara McCarty, explains that these products "put the magnifying glass up to something others might experience every day". These new products not only improve the lives of many people physically, but emotionally, too!




People Who Don't Forget
Health
Can you remember what you did every day for the past year? This is an easy task for someone with HSAM. HSAM stands for Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory. It's the ability to recall what you did every day starting from a young age (often around 10 or 12). Name a date within this range and someone with HSAM will remember what day of the week it was, what he or she did that day, and even what the weather was like.
Jill Price was the first person to be identified with HSAM. In 2000, at age 34, she was overwhelmed by the memories flooding her head. So she made an appointment with neurobiologist Dr. James McGaugh at the University of California to see if he could help her.
McGaugh had never met anyone like Price. Each time he mentioned a date, Price told him what historical event happened on that day. Even though HSAM involves recalling personal experiences, if a news event coincides with one of those experiences, a person with HSAM will remember it, too. Price knew, for example, that famous singer/actor Bing Crosby had died on Friday, October 14, 1977, because she remembered hearing it on the car radio on her way to soccer practice.
Since Price's meeting with McGaugh, about 60 additional people have been identified with HSAM (also called hyperthymesia). Brain scans on HSAM subjects reveal structural differences in certain areas of their brains. But scientists don't know if these differences are what cause HSAM, or if the constant recall of memories creates these differences. They are trying to find out more. McGaugh says people with HSAM are "very poor at forgetting," which is why studying their brains can be very helpful. "We know an awful lot about the conditions which create memories," McGaugh explains. "We know very little about what happens when people forget."
This inability to forget can be difficult for people with HSAM.  A bad memory from 20 years ago can still feel fresh. "If I'm remembering or recalling a memory, I'm almost reliving it emotionally as well," says 32-year-old Joey DeGrandis. But DeGrandis also appreciates his HSAM memory. "Even though sometimes the bad memories may haunt me, I think that overall I'm happy to have the ability."

Can you remember what you did every day last year? This is an easy task for someone with HSAM. HSAM is the ability to remember what you did every single day starting from a certain age (often around 10 or 12). HSAM stands for Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory. When people with HSAM are told a date, they can recall what they did on that day, what day of the week it was, and even what the weather was like.
Jill Price was the first person identified with HSAM. In 2000, Price met with neurobiologist Dr. James McGaugh of the University of California. McGaugh tested Price's memory. He named dates, and Price told him what world events had happened on those dates. Someone with HSAM can recall a world event if it coincided with a personal experience. For example, Price remembered that singer Bing Crosby died on October 14, 1977, because she heard the news on the radio on her way to soccer practice.
Today, researchers know of about 60 people with HSAM. And they are finding out more about the HSAM brain. McGaugh describes people with HSAM as being "very poor at forgetting," which is why they can be a goldmine for scientists. According to McGaugh, scientists know a lot about how memories are created, but know little about what happens when people forget.
Being unable to forget isn't always a good thing.  A negative experience from years ago can feel fresh. Joey DeGrandis, a 32-year-old with HSAM, says that when he recalls a memory, the old emotions come back, too. But overall, DeGrandis appreciates his HSAM. "I'm happy to have the ability," he says.

Jill Price can remember what she did every day when she was 12 years old. And she can remember what she did every day after that! Price has HSAM. HSAM is a kind of "super" memory. People with HSAM remember most days of their lives.
In the year 2000, Price met a scientist named James McGaugh. McGaugh tested Price's memory. McGaugh picked dates in the calendar. Price told McGaugh what news event happened on each day. She remembered because she could recall what she was doing at the time. For example, Price remembered that on October 14, 1977, her mother drove her to soccer practice. On the way, they heard the news that the singer Bing Crosby died. So Price remembered that Bing Crosby died on October 14, 1977.
Price was the first person scientists ever saw with HSAM. Today, scientists know of 61 people with HSAM. Joey DeGrandis is one of these people. He says having HSAM can be hard. Some memories you want to forget. But he says, "Overall, I'm happy to have the ability."




What Color Is It?
Health
How do people see colors? There are special cells inside the human eye. These cells send messages to the brain about color. Look at a blue dress. How do you know it's blue? The special cells tell your brain it's blue. But some people's cells don't work correctly. They send the wrong message to the brain. People who get the wrong messages from their eyes have color blindness.
People with color blindness see colors differently from other people. One in 12 men and one in 200 women have color blindness. Nothing can cure color blindness. But wearing special glasses can help. One company that makes these glasses is Enchroma. The lenses in Enchroma's glasses have filters. Many people with color blindness tried Enchroma's glasses. They put them on and... wow! Suddenly, people with color blindness saw real colors. And they can see a beautiful blue dress, too!

What Color Is It?
Health
Is it white and gold, or blue and black? In February 2015, a picture of a striped dress was shared on the Internet. More than 30 million people saw the photograph, and they couldn't all agree about the colors they saw. Suddenly, everyone was talking about how humans perceive color. The confusion about the color of the dress may have helped some viewers understand people who have color blindness.
The human eye has special cells called cones, which tell the brain what colors to perceive. When a person with color blindness looks at certain colors, the cones send the wrong message to their brain about the true color. Like many people who saw "the dress", color-blind people see colors differently.
One in 12 men and one in 200 women have color blindness. Red-green color blindness is the most common type. People with color blindness can have many difficulties. Young schoolchildren might feel embarrassed if they use the "wrong" color. Drivers with color blindness are more likely to cause traffic accidents - they can confuse red and green lights. People with color blindness are even unable to work in some professions.
There's no cure for color blindness. However, different companies have developed glasses to correct the problem. One company, Enchroma, makes glasses which allow around 80% of people with color blindness to see colors that they never could before. The lenses on Enchroma's glasses have filters that change how the wearer perceives colors. The glasses, introduced in 2012, aren't cheap - they can cost up to $429 . But Enchroma's glasses could help people see the actual colors of that famous dress!

In February 2015, a photograph of a striped dress went viral on the Internet. More than 30 million people looked at the photograph, but not everyone could agree on its color scheme. Those who said it was blue and black argued with those who saw it as white and gold. The debate became a worldwide, social media sensation, and shined a spotlight on the way humans perceive color. And some viewers, particularly those who saw colors that weren't there, got a small sense of what life must be like for people with color blindness.
Color blindness is a genetic condition that occurs when special cells in the eye called cones are abnormal. Cones tell the brain what colors to perceive. When a person with color blindness looks at certain colors, the abnormal cones give the brain the wrong message about the true color. Like many people who saw the blue and black dress as white and gold, color-blind people see colors differently.
One in 12 men and one in 200 women have color blindness, and red-green color blindness is the most common type. Color blindness brings with it many challenges. Young schoolchildren sometimes feel embarrassed when they use the "wrong" color to complete a task. Color-blind adults who can't differentiate between red or green traffic signals are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents. In Romania and Turkey, people with color blindness aren't even permitted to get a driver's license. Additionally, some professions, in the arts and military for instance, simply aren't options for people with color blindness.
Currently, there's no cure for genetic color blindness. However, different companies have developed glasses to correct the problem. One company, Enchroma, makes indoor lenses and sunglasses with filters that change the way light enters the eye, affecting how the wearer perceives colors. These glasses enable around 80% of people with color blindness to see colors that they never could before. Although the glasses are expensive (costs range from $349 to $429 dollars), millions of dollars' worth of glasses have been sold since being introduced in 2012. While not exactly a cure, Enchroma's glasses might help people with color blindness correctly identify the colors of that famous dress!




Can Boredom Be Good For You?
Health
What makes you feel bored? Many people are bored when they do routine tasks, such as washing the dishes, cutting vegetables for a salad, waiting for a bus, or standing in line. Well, did you know that being bored is not a waste of time? Taking time to be bored, to allow your brain to relax and wander, can actually be good for you!

Do you want to be more creative? Being bored may help you with that. Psychologist Sandi Mann from the University of Central Lancashire in England wanted to understand the effect of boredom on our lives. In one study, Dr. Mann had two groups of people complete a creative task: finding as many uses as they could for two cups. Before doing the creative task, one group performed a boring activity: they copied telephone numbers from a phone book. The other group did not do the boring task. Dr. Mann discovered that participants who completed the boring task were much more creative in coming up with ideas for the cups. She believes that boredom encourages people's minds to wander, which leads them to more creative ways of thinking. Dr. Mann doesn't think we should fear boredom. "We should embrace it," she says. She also believes it is important for children to be bored. "Unlike so many parents today, I am quite happy when my kids whine that they are bored. Finding ways to amuse themselves is an important skill."

Being bored can also encourage you to seek out activities that help other people. While at the University of Limerick, in Ireland, psychologist Wijnand van Tilburg researched boredom. He found that bored people often feel that their actions are meaningless, and they respond to their boredom by seeking out meaningful activities. "Boredom makes people long for different and purposeful activities, and as a result they turn towards more challenging and meaningful activities," explains Dr. van Tilburg. He believes his research shows that boredom can promote behavior that benefits society.

So, sit back, relax, let your mind wander, and feel good about being bored. It could help you become more creative and encourage you to find more meaningful ways to spend your time.

Super Suit
Health
It's hard for some people to walk, sit, or stand. Their bones and muscles are weak. Now, there is a special suit to help these people. It's called the "Aura Powered Suit".

People wear the suit under their clothes. It looks like gym clothes. The suit uses special technology that soldiers use. The technology in the Aura Powered Suit helps people climb stairs, sit down, and stand up. The suit supports a person's torso, hips, and legs.

On the suit there are pods. The pods are in the shape of hexagons. Inside the pods are motors, batteries, and control boards. The pods sit over certain muscles. The pods help these muscles work.

A company called Superflex made the suit. A designer named Yves Behar helped them make it. A sample of the Aura Powered Suit was in the London Design Museum. Many people came to see it.

Rich Mahoney is the cofounder of Superflex. He thinks the Aura Powered Suit will improve people's lives and keep them healthier longer.

Aging is a fact of life. We can't escape it. But what if there were a way to make our bodies more mobile as we age? Now there is - thanks to technology company Superflex and designer Yves Behar. It's called the "Aura Powered Suit". And it's putting 'power' back into the bodies of those who need it.

The Superflex team worked together with Behar and his team of industrial designers at fuseproject design agency, to create the Aura Powered Suit. The super suit is designed to help people with mobility issues, such as seniors or people with physical disabilities. The suit uses technology originally developed to help soldiers in the army. The technology in the Aura Powered Suit supports people who have difficulty climbing stairs or standing up from a sitting position.

The Aura Powered Suit is made from lightweight materials. It is worn under regular clothing. The suit looks similar to gym clothing. It was important for Behar to come up with a design that looked modern and stylish.

The difference between the Aura Powered Suit and other workout outfits is that it has pods. The pods are in the shape of hexagons. The pods are clustered around particular muscles. Inside the pods are motors, batteries, and control boards. The pods work with the body, stretching along with the wearer's movements. The suit supports the torso, hips, and legs, as a person gets up, sits down, or stays standing.

A prototype of the Aura Powered Suit was first shown at the London Design Museum exhibition, New Old. The cofounder and CEO of Superflex, Rich Mahoney, believes that "Superflex's new powered clothing technology means that people will lead fuller, healthier, and more rewarding lives."

Aging is an eventuality that humans cannot escape. Yet, what if there were a way to increase the mobility of our aging bodies? Now there is - thanks to technology company Superflex and designer Yves Behar. It's called the "Aura Powered Suit", and it's putting the 'power' back into the bodies of those who need it.

Superflex collaborated with Behar and his team of industrial designers at fuseproject design agency, to create a super powered suit. The suit aims to increase the quality of life of people with mobility issues, such as seniors or people with physical disabilities. The suit uses technology originally developed for the military, to help soldiers carry heavy loads and increase their jumping capabilities.

As a person's muscles and bones lose strength, it becomes increasingly difficult to accomplish even the simplest physical tasks. The technology used in Superflex's suit aids people who struggle to climb stairs or stand up from a sitting position.

The Aura Powered Suit is expertly designed using lightweight materials. It's worn under a person's regular clothing. Outwardly, it looks similar to stylish workout clothing people wear in the gym. This is an important feature, as it doesn't resemble the geriatric style of clothing or equipment designed for similar purposes.

The difference between the Aura Powered Suit and any other sleek workout outfit is that it has pods attached to it. The hexagonal-shaped pods are clustered around particular muscles. Inside the pods are motors, batteries, and control boards. The pods are the "electric muscles" of the suit. They work with the body, expanding and contracting with the wearer's movements. The suit is meant to provide support to the torso, hips, and legs, as a person gets up, sits down, or remains standing.

A prototype of the Aura Powered Suit was first displayed at the London Design Museum exhibition, New Old. Cofounder and CEO of Superflex, Rich Mahoney, believes that, "Superflex's new powered clothing technology means that people will lead fuller, healthier, and more rewarding lives."
