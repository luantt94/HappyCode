a problem, mistake, or weak point
Due to a small flaw in design, we had to delay selling the product by two months.
In our company, we were encouraged to learn about our flaws so that we could be a stronger team that is always improving.

hitch
a problem
We hit a small hitch about three months into development; which is when our product models started breaking.
There have been a few hitches in the past six weeks, such as a few customer complaints, but we took care of them quickly, so our company is doing well again.

hurdle
a problem or issue that must be solved to continue
There were some hurdles to jump early on.
When another company stole our design, it was a huge hurdle, but after some time, we created a new design that was even better than the last one.

setback
a problem that makes a situation more difficult or makes something happen more slowly
After the company's initial setback, we decided to work with a web designer, who helped improve our website.
This setback is huge and is going to delay product delivery two whole months; we cannot make more products when our machines are not working.

shortcoming
not having a skill, quality, or knowledge
Although the delivery service had a few shortcomings, on the whole things worked out fine.
My biggest shortcoming was that I did not have much experience with handling money, so I employed a financial expert to help me.

unforeseen
unexpected
Unfortunately, we had an unforeseen problem.
The manager had an unforeseen change in her plans, so she could not meet with me.

ups and downs
rising then falling
Even though we had our share of ups and downs in the beginning, we were quite pleased with the results.
There have definitely been a lot of ups and downs in the past few months; sometimes computers sold really well, and sometimes they did not.

acclaimed
shown to be liked and respected by many people
We're highly acclaimed for our luxury clothes.
I work for an acclaimed company that is well-known on six of the seven continents.

based
used to explain where something comes from
It's a Chicago-based online gift company.
The store is Newark-based, but their products sold better in New York City, so they moved there last year.

first-rate
very good; the best
They're a first-rate gift company that only sells expensive, excellent products online.
Our goal is to be a first-rate toy company that is known all over the world.

franchise
a business given the right to sell a company's goods
This is a franchise of a Boston-based company.
We did not want to take the time to start our own company, so we decided to open a store of a well-known franchise.

multinational
having offices in more than one country
Since we're a multinational company, you will not work here in the United States; you will work in England.
“The best part of working for a multinational company,” said Jude, “is that you will be able to travel for work.”

to trade
to buy and sell goods and services
How has trading goods outside the country helped your business?
The United States has been trading products with other countries for hundreds of years.
